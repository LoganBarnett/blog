In this episode, our hero (that&rsquo;s you!) will be learning a tool that is helpful
in virtually any kind of development you will wind up working in: Version
control. Version control is rarely taught in school. It can be somewhat a deep
topic, but we&rsquo;ll go over some basics of how you see it in the open source world,
which can carry over significantly to the commercial world.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-what's-version-control" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what's-version-control"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> what&rsquo;s version control?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what's-version-control">
<p>
Version control is like the double-entry bookkeeping technique of saving all
of your hard work. If you recall on the last lesson, there was an off-the-cuff
statement about how your computer is just a fancy interface for working with
files. Version control typically excels at handling text files. This blog post
is a text file. HTML is text files. The original file that the blog post is
generated from is a text file. SVG images are also text files. There&rsquo;s also
non-text files. Generally we call these binary files, but really we could also
call them shit-files. That&rsquo;s a completely objective industry term and not me
showing any bias at all. Honest.
</p>

<p>
Double entry bookkeeping is something you might have had some exposure to in
grade school, where you have to write down every credit and debit that hits
your account, and there will be a corresponding debit or credit on some other
account. It&rsquo;s a ruthlessly simple model for handling money. We&rsquo;re going to use
a ruthlessly simple model for handling changes in text files. Version control
systems can handle binary files too, but things are more eww there, so we&rsquo;re
just going to skip over that for now.
</p>

<p>
Like the bookkeeping stuff, version control is expressed as just a series of
changes. Sure, you can write down what the final amount is somewhere in your
checking account, but the final amount is always some composition of all the
credits and debits since the dawn of time against your account. In the same
way any given text file can be seen as the composition of <b>changes</b> happening
over time to a text file.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-why" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> why?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why">
<p>
There&rsquo;s a lot of benefits that fall out of version control, but perhaps a
primary driver for it is it allows us to capture a state in time that your
source code was in. As of version x in the software, some things might be
known such as features, bugs, and other behaviors. If we need to, we can go
back to that point. We can make fixes against software that we released a
while back.
</p>

<p>
Making fixes against older versions of the software can be helpful if we&rsquo;re
working on some shiny new feature, but we found out some critical bug in our
software that our uses are on right now. Caught with our proverbial software
pants down, we don&rsquo;t want to have to discard our current work nor do we want
to inflict some half-complete feature upon our users. Instead we can get in
our version-control-time-machine and assume a prior state of the code base,
make the fix, and roll it out. Once we&rsquo;re done we can switch back to working
on our shiny new feature.
</p>

<p>
At its most basic form, version control can serve as a super efficient text
backup system. It keeps a history of all of your changes made in little slices
at a time, and it stores these changes are just a series of changes (add this
line here, remove this other one, etc). Even if you aren&rsquo;t planning on doing
releases/rollbacks, or don&rsquo;t want to share code with others, you <span class="underline">need</span> to be
on version control. And believe me, if you want to find work out there, it
will be a boon in a job interview for your first position to be able to say
&ldquo;yeah I use this&rdquo;. Otherwise they&rsquo;ll have to teach it to you, and while that&rsquo;s
all find and good, this is a fundamental skill we expect software engineers in
the industry to know.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-git" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="git"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> git</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-git">
<p>
There are lots of version control systems out there, but <code>git</code> is kind of the
gold standard. Open source, free, and serverless, <code>git</code> can be very powerful
(thus very complicated) and an easy defacto standard for version control
software.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re on MacOS, you might have <code>git</code> installed already. That&rsquo;s okay but
let&rsquo;s make sure we&rsquo;re on the latest version with this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ brew install <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
While waiting for that to install, let&rsquo;s go over some <code>git</code> trivia. <code>git</code> was
a tool born of necessity as part of working on the Linux kernel. Torvalds
stated he named it &ldquo;git&rdquo; (roughly meaning idiot) because he needed to be
reminded that he was an idiot, or something. <code>git</code> transformed an insanely
vast open source project into something more manageable. <code>git</code> is
&ldquo;distributed&rdquo;, meaning there&rsquo;s no central server that you <span class="underline">must</span> use. This
allows for arbitrary organization of your repository. Repository is the word
we give to a single code base, but repository doesn&rsquo;t imply code since it
works with just text. Sometimes we call a repository a &ldquo;repo&rdquo; for short.
</p>

<p>
This arbitrary organization allowed the Linux kernel to be divided up in a
more organic fashion. Linus Torvalds could assign a kind of trust to
&ldquo;generals&rdquo; in his open source army, who in turn could have lieutenants. This
means there&rsquo;s a kind of flow to the work being done. Lieutenants contribute to
various changes in the code base, which get reviewed, corrected, and vetted by
the generals. The generals then present the changes to Linus directly. This is
really helpful when you maintain a complex operating system kernel on largely
your spare time.
</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-first-repo"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> creating your first repo</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-creating-your-first-repo">
<p>
From working on our prior <code>cat-hatred</code> directory, we already have a code base
ready to become a repository.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">cd</span> ~/dev/cat-hatred
</pre>
</div>

<p>
From here, we can do our initialization command.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> init

Initialized empty Git repository<span style="color: #51afef;"> in</span> /Users/me/dev/cat-hatred/.git/
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That&rsquo;s it for making the repo! Kind of.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-ignoring-files" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="ignoring-files"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> ignoring files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ignoring-files">
<p>
We&rsquo;re not going to add everything to the repository.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-ignoring-files--generated-files" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="ignoring-files--generated-files"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> generated files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ignoring-files--generated-files">
<p>
Generally we want to not add generated files to our version control. This is
because generated files can get large, unwieldy, and they are generally
derived from some other authoritative file. This means pretty much anyone can
regenerate those files at any time if we needed them. We want to discourage
editing of generated files because when you run the generator again, and now
you can see there&rsquo;s a change, who is correct in that change? It&rsquo;s hard to
provide a concretely correct answer there, so best to opt out of that risk in
the first place. If we need the generated files changed, we should assume the
generator is always safe to run and that the source file that produces the
generated file will somehow reflect the needed changes.
</p>

<p>
Since we&rsquo;re in a Node project, the <code>node_modules</code> directory fits this bill
perfectly of a series of generated files. The entire directory is managed by
our package manager (for us, <code>yarn</code>). We want to ignore <code>node_modules</code>. <code>git</code>
conventionally uses a <code>.gitignore</code> file to list file/directory names and
patterns in order to ensure those files aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;checked in&rdquo;. &ldquo;Checking in&rdquo; is
something we do with our files. I don&rsquo;t recall if <code>git</code> specifically uses that
terminology but I&rsquo;m a little old and some the vocabulary from older systems
will bleed over there. Rest assured there are people older than me in software
engineering probably.
</p>

<p>
We can create our <code>.gitignore</code> file and add <code>node_modules</code> to it in one
stroke:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">echo</span> <span style="color: #7bc275;">"node_modules"</span> &gt; .gitignore
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-ignoring-files--editor-specific-files" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="ignoring-files--editor-specific-files"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> editor specific files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ignoring-files--editor-specific-files">
<p>
Depending on your editor choice, this may not be the complete story. Editors
love to store their project+editor unique settings in a given repository. It
would be easy to find out what those files are named and also add them to
<code>.gitignore</code> but I urge you not to do that. There are a <span class="underline">lot</span> of editors out
there, and you don&rsquo;t want to inflict your holy editor upon others (just like
you wouldn&rsquo;t want their garbage editors inflicted upon you). In this case
&ldquo;others&rdquo; can also be your future self. For example, I&rsquo;m going strong on Emacs
right now, but I can quickly recall using seven other editors I&rsquo;ve used
before that, each with its own config files. It&rsquo;s your responsibility to
avoid adding unnecessary clutter to the repository.
</p>

<p>
With <code>git</code> you can add a global ignore file like so:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> config --global core.excludesfile <span style="color: #7bc275;">'~/.gitignore'</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Find out what your editor&rsquo;s temporary and hidden files are and add them to
this global git ignore file. If you change editors later, simply add to the
file. You can even add ignore settings for your operating system as well
(think <code>Thumbs.db</code> from Windows and <code>.DS_Store</code> on MacOS).
</p>

<p>
While digging around for examples I found this excellent <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global">gitignore repository</a>
where you can just lift settings for your editor and/or operating system. You
can copy across multiple files, just separate them with lines. You can add
comments starting with the <code>#</code> character to document sections if you like.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-adding-your-files" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="adding-your-files"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> adding your files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-adding-your-files">
<p>
Make sure if you&rsquo;re jumping around that you&rsquo;ve handled everything in the
<a href="#ignoring-files">5</a> section. Now we&rsquo;re going to add files to this repository.
First, we can look to see what files are available with the <code>git status</code>
command.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> status

On branch master

Untracked files:
  <span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>use <span style="color: #7bc275;">"</span><span style="color: #7bc275;">git</span><span style="color: #7bc275;"> add &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to include<span style="color: #51afef;"> in</span> what will be committed<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>

  accept-test.sh
  .gitignore
  package.json
  server.js
  yarn.lock

nothing added to commit but untracked files present <span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>use <span style="color: #7bc275;">"</span><span style="color: #7bc275;">git</span><span style="color: #7bc275;"> add"</span> to track<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Your version may be more colorful than my post&rsquo;s, and that&rsquo;s okay. Generally
untracked and modified files are displayed in red. Files that are &ldquo;staged&rdquo; for
commit are shown in green. I realized red/green color blindness is very
common, and I think these colors can be configured, but I haven&rsquo;t looked into
that yet.
</p>

<p>
To stage these files, we can use <code>git add &lt;file1&gt;, &lt;file2&gt;, ...</code>. You can also
indicate a directory and it will get everything under that directory that
isn&rsquo;t being ignored. Ignored files won&rsquo;t show up in the <code>git status</code> output
<span class="underline">so long as they weren&rsquo;t committed earlier</span>.
</p>

<p>
If your output differs than mine above then definitely ask about it, or
retrace your steps. It can be a pain to take out files you didn&rsquo;t mean to add.
You also lose badass points.
</p>

<p>
Once you&rsquo;ve made sure that&rsquo;s all correct, we&rsquo;ll add these files just one at a
time to get used to the flow:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> add accept-test.sh .gitignore package.json server.js yarn.lock
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And now when you do <code>git status</code> again, you should see these are ready to
commit:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> status

On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  <span style="color: #51afef;">(</span>use <span style="color: #7bc275;">"</span><span style="color: #7bc275;">git</span><span style="color: #7bc275;"> </span><span style="color: #7bc275;">rm</span><span style="color: #7bc275;"> --cached &lt;file&gt;..."</span> to unstage<span style="color: #51afef;">)</span>

  new file:   .gitignore
  new file:   accept-test.sh
  new file:   package.json
  new file:   server.js
  new file:   yarn.lock
</pre>
</div>

<p>
All of the files will be green! And it describes that they are ready to be
committed. Let&rsquo;s commit them!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-committing-files" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="committing-files"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> committing files</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-committing-files">
<p>
Regardless of where you stand with commitment, you must commit your files or
this just isn&rsquo;t going to work between us. Generally when you issue a commit
command, you are presented with your editor (whatever your system has listed
for <code>EDITOR</code> in your shell&rsquo;s environment variables - frequently this is <code>nano</code>
or <code>vim</code> but could be configured to be a number of things). This is so we can
write a meaningful message for our commit. Instead of getting into those
editors, we&rsquo;re going to use the <code>-m</code> flag to specify the commit message for
today.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">$ <span style="color: #FCCE7B;">git</span> commit -m <span style="color: #7bc275;">"initial commit"</span>

  create mode <span style="color: #e69055; font-weight: bold;">100644</span> yarn.lock
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The exact commit hash (<code>8aed320</code>) and insertions may differ for you and that&rsquo;s
okay. Although the files listed should be the same. That&rsquo;s our first commit!
</p>

<p>
In <code>git</code>, everything is represented as a series of commits along these things
called branches or &ldquo;refs&rdquo;. We&rsquo;ll get more into branching later.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-pushing-files" class="outline-2">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-pushing-files">
<p>
Right now, if your machine just caught fire and melted, you&rsquo;d still lose your
work forever and you&rsquo;d probably be really sad because you lost all of this and
those questionable pictures you weren&rsquo;t sure if you should put in a shared
location for privacy reasons. All the work we&rsquo;ve done thus far in <code>git</code> has
been local. That means you could do this without any server connection. You
can now bring your laptop out to the wilderness on that stupid camping trip
and tell your hippie friends to piss off while you whip up a script that
replaces their dog walking talents with a Roomba, and then commit that shit.
I&rsquo;m not bitter.
</p>

<p>
We want to push your commit up to a server. There&rsquo;s a number of places we can
put this, and they are free. Generally I use Github for my public stuff, and
Bitbucket for my private stuff (both of which are free for their public and
private use, respectively). There&rsquo;s also Gitlab, which you can self host and
there&rsquo;s an online version, but I&rsquo;m less familiar with its monetary aspects.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-pushing-files--github" class="outline-4">

<p>
Go to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and setup an account there. Follow their instructions for
setting up an SSH key. This will take some time and that&rsquo;s okay.
</p>

<p>
Once it&rsquo;s done, you can create a new repository by going to their <a href="https://github.com/new">new
repository page</a>. Name the project &ldquo;cat-hatred&rdquo; (avoid spaces and caps!). You
can leave the rest blank or default, and just click the create repository
button. If you decided to go with something that&rsquo;s not Github, that&rsquo;s okay
and the steps will likely be similar.
</p>

<p>
Once you did that successfully, you&rsquo;ll be on a page that shows you what the
repository git URL is. For me, it&rsquo;s
<code>git@github.com:LoganBarnett/cat-hatred.git</code>. Yours will be similar but
using your username instead of mine. Make sure you use yours and not mine!
Okay?
</p>

<p>
Okay.
</p>

<p>
Copy that URL and go back to your terminal. You can add the repository to
&ldquo;origin&rdquo;, which is kind of a default &ldquo;remote&rdquo; (we&rsquo;ll dive into that more
later).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
That&rsquo;s what my command looks like - don&rsquo;t forget that yours should be using
your username so it will be different than mine!
</p>

<p>
Once that&rsquo;s done, we can do our first push with this command:

Assuming everything went without a hitch, you&rsquo;ll see some output like that.
It will take a couple of seconds typically, as now you&rsquo;re reaching over a
network. Congrats! You can even browse to your repo&rsquo;s page on Github and see
the source code there. Mine is here:

There&rsquo;s a <b>lot</b> more to <code>git</code> than what I&rsquo;ve shown you thus far, but now you
can continue to do work, commit files that you change or add, and push them to

<code>git</code>. For a solo endeavor, the skillset you have now will suffice. Now we can
