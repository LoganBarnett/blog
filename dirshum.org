** Golani Grumsvelt's Guide to Dirshum

   :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum
   :END:
   This is a series of essays written in the voice of [[Golani Grumsvelt]], a
   pompous and arrogantly privileged playboy. He tends to dismiss mythical
   things, in spite of how true they might actually be.

*** Account of Duranae
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--account-of-duranae
    :END:
    Nicknamed "Jewel of Dirshum", Duranae has established itself as a grand
    intersection of being both a melting pot of cultures and a city that
    prospers from all of the things our magical realm has to offer. It has a
    population of roughly three million souls (determined through magical
    scrying). Sitting in the middle of the world and a coastal city, it has an
    advantaged position for trade. All walks of life can be found here, but it
    is predominantly human in the populace. While the races do mix there, they
    also tend to gather in their own burrows and neighborhoods. It's rumored
    some of the dwarves of Dirshum never see the light of day, content to work
    their trades in the areas below.

    Duranae has a little bit of something for everyone, except for privacy of
    course. It's a city you can easily disappear in, but you're never by
    yourself no matter how alone you might feel.

    Areas in Duranae can be rough 5 major sections. The outer city comprises the
    farmlands. These are protected by the city watch, but aside from occasional
    patrols this is more of a first-responder force. The farms provide some
    sustenance for the city, but it is not nearly enough to sustain a population
    of this magnitude. The primary crops consist of potatoes, wheat, and other
    cheap-to-grow foods that are appropriate for the teeming masses.

    As you move further into the city, before its walls, you will come across
    its slums. These are hodge podge sheds and rickety dwellings that lean up
    against the walls of Duranae. This is where the poorest of the poor live.
    The city guards rarely patrol here, and those that do have a very cynical
    outlook on life and their guard duties as well. EDIT: And let me tell you,
    threatening me to divulge my sources is a criminal act! Or at least it
    should be. I am your humble explorer - a cartographer of societies! Not a
    study of the laws of just one city. But worry not Sheriff Vrot: Your guards
    will still let me in the city if I make their pouches bulbous enough with
    coin.

    The third section, past the walls, is a place most people have been to and
    think of when they mention Duranae. This is the middle quarter. It extends
    from the walls marking the slums and farmlands all the way to the coast.
    This is where the docks conduct their day to day affairs. Nomasgard has a
    section of the docks devoted to its navy. Other parts of the docks are
    closely connected to the bean counters of the trading guilds, and all goods
    are carefully monitored and recorded. After seeing that, I wish I'd
    considered starting a lucrative venture in parchment making! There are also
    less savory parts of the docks. The privateer wharfs is a very no
    questions-asked kind of place. My brave assistants stood firmly to see and
    record everything though. Only a total of three fingers were lost during
    entire endeavor. I count that a success. Ah - one more notable thing: the
    middle quarter of Duranae is a large, think ring. The middle is empty! But
    that brings us to our next section.

    The fourth section is the lower quarter. Some of it sees sunlight, but much
    of it is underground. In the middle quarter, the cityscape will rapidly
    transition downhill and end in a great lift. Here the goods from below come
    up, and the supplies needed for the city's lower area go down. Many dwarves
    live in the lower quarter, but it's not exclusive to them. Much of the
    digging is done by kobolds that I am assured to be quite friendly, but sadly
    I could not spare assistants that day to test this claim. The kobolds have
    dug out much of the aqueducts, channels of lava flow for the forges, and
    even much of the mining. The dwarves there claim it is shoddy work, but even
    they admit the city rests easily upon all of it. I couldn't find a single
    gnome there!

    Going further up from the middle quarter is the fifth and final section: The
    upper quarter. The upper quarter is a ring that is wider than Duranae's
    middle quarter. This is the floating part of the city, suspended high above
    the highest buildings in the middle quarter. The lift from the lower quarter
    reaches all the way to the upper quarter. The center where the lift reaches
    the height of the upper quarter is a series crystalline bridges that run to
    the ring where the upper quarter proper is. All goods go through the
    strictest of checks, and the guards here are well paid by the trade guilds
    to ensure no bribery can ever work. Here is where you can find the finest
    food, wines, clothing, and even the most beautiful of the goodly races, no
    matter what your preferences are. There are many elves and gnomes here. Any
    artisan with a valuable trade can make a go here. Every single dwelling here
    has a view that stretches inwards to the below quarters or out into the
    beautiful countryside or coast of Nomasgard, depending on where you rest
    upon the ring.

    My later chapters will cover arcane influences on Duranae, the religious
    establishments, and law and crime. Duranae is such a rich and wonderful city
    that also has many secrets and splendors - all you have to do is look!
*** Avandra's Smile
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--avandra's-smile
    :END:

    Taken from Golani Grumsvelt's "Avandra's Smile", which was delayed in its
    printing due to a strange goblin raid on the trade lines carrying inks:

    Avandra has smiled upon all of us at one point or another in our lives.
    Every time we attribute some favorable event as luck, we pay her a small
    amount of reverence, and this sustains the goddess. Or so the priests of her
    clergy tell me.

    As part of our cataloging of the entire world of Duranae, we sometimes have
    to do brave or absurd things. This time, bravery was not in high demand. We
    entered as recent converts to a location I will not disclose today, and we
    were able to learn much of the inner workings of the goddess and her
    followers with an inside perspective.

    The priests themselves are aloof and superstitious, and will attribute every
    bloody sunny day in a summer to their goddess. They also carry around
    sentimental trinkets that are unique to the individual, and they seem to
    constantly fidget with it. You'd think it were a holy symbol with how the
    priests grasp them! The priests feel that avoiding bad luck is just another
    form of good luck. As a result they do all kinds of things to avoid bad luck
    that we heard as children: They only walk on the right side of a fountain,
    they avoid crossing the path of a black cat, and sprinkle their doorways
    with spices during the 13th day of the month. Between myself and my
    assistants infiltrating their order, we mixed up which superstitions we
    chose in advance, but nobody seemed to notice. They are just happy to see
    other people saying everything is good or bad luck!

    Temples of Avandra are established places in part because it is not easy to
    have sacred grounds on the move. There have been attempts at wheeled temples
    in the past, but they never proved out. Instead they settle on doing
    frequent redecoration. Avandra is also an aspect of change. The temples are
    very open places and the winds can be felt shifting about no matter where
    you stand. At the center of this is a fountain and it's typically littered
    with copper coins. The clergy cleans it out daily and uses the coins as
    donations. What Avandra gives to those who toss coins in her fountains we
    did not find out.

    Many deities reinvest in the societies that invest in their own churches.
    Avandra's is no different. She deeply invests in the arts, fashion, music.
    Avandra's followers also run many orphanages. The orphanages are stinking
    cesspits crowded with simple brats! I lost my best shoes to one of those
    thieving curs! But it makes one realize just how relative luck can be for
    these orphanages to be considered good fortune for someone.

    Unless you've suffered some kind of recent memory loss by an evil wizard,
    you'll have heard "Avandra smile upon you!" or some similar statement. In
    the common tongue this can show someone's eloquent upbringing and for the
    masses it can sometimes be used facetiously.

    Avandra's teachings guide us to live in the moment, take risks (fortune does
    not come often at random but needs opportunity), and to ourselves be good
    luck to others by readily offering help to any in need. As a result, she has
    the most of her divinely blessed follows afield, manifesting good works in
    her name. You'd think she encourages all of them to buffoons about their
    inert little trinkets as well, for as good as the clergy follow that
    pattern.

    Paladins of her order tend to favor longer weapons and lighter armor.
    Bringing good luck in the form of help to others is the essence of these
    martial priests. I saw one whose mount was a beautiful fey horse, which you
    can learn about in my other book: Fey-folk of Duranae. Her less martial
    followers dress very plainly for the road, but you can always pick them
    apart by their wavy lined holy symbols and belts adorned with various good
    luck charms.

    Avandra opposes devils above all. The contract locks things in and is used
    to restrict fortune in the future. It robs those in the contract of their
    future consent and therefore their freedom to have a blessed life. Devils
    encompass everything she hates about contracts and how the fine print always
    seems to capture mortals. She spends a lot of effort trying to thwart their
    plans, but as gods do not directly exert their will in our realm, it's very
    easy for the devils to operate without much interference. Some things they
    catch, but much slips past her watch. For that matter she finds non-devilish
    contracts distasteful for the same reasons. I for one feel this is naive
    even for a god. My contracts I've established ensure I have a good and long
    service from my assistants if they want to get paid. The turnover is very
    high in my field!

    Throughout history Avandra's power has waxed and waned. When she had a
    disproportionate number of followers in the past, art flourished, gambling
    institutions suffered, and rulers had a hard time keeping their thrones
    under their rumps. When her followers dwindled, fashion stagnated, family
    lines tended to keep their rule for generations, and people generally had a
    sour outlook on their lives.

    The last chosen of Avandra was a halfling named Rendil Fulburrow. It was
    only revealed afterwards that he was a chosen, and he had no idea. Rendil,
    simply put, is a fool that should have died long before history wrote his
    name down. Every poor expense turned into some wonderful investment. Dangers
    were diverted around him without his knowing, and he merrily strode along as
    he did his "long walk" across the continent. He even wrote about his
    travels, but even Avandra can't overcome the raw sales of my works! Quality
    means something, my dear.

    Avandra's relationships with the other gods is rather fleeting. In one
    moment she will embrace Corellon as a the godly equivalent of a mate, and
    other times they are all but enemies. It sounds like my third ex wife! Feel
    free to pick up a copy of "The Wives of Dirshum" to broaden your views on
    marriage.

    Sehanine is an ally of Avandra and the priests attributed this to the
    constant ebb and flow of the moon. This is utterly stupid. Changing
    constantly is still a constant! The moon moves predictably. "Charting
    Dishum's Night" covers this in great detail.

    Avandra opposes Asmodeus most of all, with Bane a close second. Tyranny in
    all of its forms is what she hates, and what those two bring about. It is
    rumored that Avandra has specially appointed members of her church that hunt
    down devil cults and slay them all before they grow too strong. Believe me
    that these are myths, my friend. I have scoured our historical texts for
    mass cultist slayings and on the rare occasion that it does happen, it's
    never by some hooded priests carrying around luck rabbits' feet!

    The clergy itself doesn't have an official structure. Most of the time they
    don't have a collective direction. When I was there I saw them determining
    some course of action for the sect, I saw them enumerate the choices and
    then cast dice. It is this author's humble opinion that the church of
    Avandra endures only because of, well, luck!

    Avandra might be an essential member of the gods but if I were to become a
    man of the cloth I'd keep looking and not leave my life up to chance.

     :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood
     :END:

     It is theorized that elves are the creations of Sehanine - an
     ever-changing shape-shifter god. Many races are said to have spawned from
     the elves. The most apparent ones are the high elves of Bel'aheldan and
     the wood elves of Minheimia.

     Less known of elvish relations are harpies, banshees, eldarin, and even
     ghouls.

     Rest assured that any form an elf takes will always be better than yours.
     Hubris!

***** harpies
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--harpies
      :END:
      Cruel and spiteful creatures, the first harpy is said to come from a
      female elf who stumbled upon Sehanine himself in a forest. Sehanine paid
      her no attention and had departed as quickly as he was noticed. But the
      elf had fallen in love. She was unable to find him, and fell into a deep
      sorrow. She cursed the gods for exposing her to such beauty. Her hatred
      took form and gave her wings, and turned her heart to evil.

      That an elf could get so resentful and disgruntled to turn their arms to
      feathered wings and legs of a bird of prey is ridiculous. Elves fall in
      love and have highly emotional heartbreaks all of the time, but we never
      hear about them turning to harpies.

***** banshees
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--banshees
      :END:

      Scholars record that Banshees are elves who lived lives of excess of
      some kind, and when they perished they continued to live on as dreadful
      undead creatures. They beautiful yet marred apparitions whose love for
      their excess continues in their restless afterlife. They dwell in their
      homes of old, usually in ruins of elven establishments. Given time they
      drive out all of the other occupants, or kill them, assuming they didn't
      do either in their former lives already.

      To stop a banshee is a boastful claim indeed. The banshee's wail brings
      their suffering unto their victims, and the wail is often too much for
      the living to bear.

      On my travels we came across forgotten wood-elven cities, and one such
      had a mirror. My companion picked it up, and looked upon it. I could see
      in the reflection a gaunt, ghostly face behind him, with glowing eyes.
      It was reaching towards him. I turned to face it, thinking the
      reflection was showing me where the real creature was. But nothing was
      there. When I turned back to my companion, Wilfred I think was his name,
      the mirror was on the ground, and Wilfred was no where to be seen. I
      looked for 10 minutes, which is twice the time I promise to any of my
      guides.

      In my nightmares I think of that face in the mirror. I still remember
      Wilfred's face staring back at me too. The face in the mirror perfectly
      matches the accounts I could find of the pale and ale-addled folks I
      could find.

      Many rumors exist of such a mirror exist. Some claim it can be a portal
      to a realm that is a dark mockery of ours called the "Shadowfell" or
      some such nonsense, and its location is always that of the banshee's
      domain. A domain locked in permanent pain and suffering. That's right,
      my friend: Even elves and their offshoots suffer better than you do.
      Others have said a blade could be forged around a shard of such a
      mirror, and its cut saps the life out of anything it touches. If one
      wielded two such blades and rang them together, it would create a
      splitting sound akin to the wail of a banshee, and to similar deadly
      effect! Fortunately we do not live in such a world of madness, and no
      scholar has documented such weapons.

      :END:

      The elves will tell you that eldarin are but a close cousin race like
      the wood elves are to the high elves, and they change their appearance
      and demeanor with the seasons. They are said to be much more strongly
      tied with the fey and share the whimsicalness that comes with it. I've
      met an eldarin once and it didn't change with the seasons, but every
      day! The elves come up with such stories, and they make things difficult
      to get a true account!

      In Bel'aheldan, even the peasant class seem to be tied with some magic.
      They have the floors swept with unmanned brooms, and clean clothes of
      their masters with but a thought.

      They call themselves the high elves - one presumes because they are so
      arrogant - and seem to universally display an affinity to the use of
      magical spells.

      The nation of Bel'aheldan itself carries with it a mission to use magic
      for the betterment of all, and rid of us the need for manual labors and
      petty chores. But they don't understand that summoned food and water can
      never beat finely aged wine. Cleaning clothing is more than washing - it
      is restoring the original lift to the clothes! What magic makes a collar
      carry the flare of knowing a servant has poured their love of the craft
      and even the love of their master into it? I still miss Wilfred's
      attention to detail. But I digress.

      When they aren't trying to foolishly rid themselves of the peasantry,
      they collectively apply magic to create wondrous infrastructure. It is
      said that even the small villages of Bel'aheldan harbor portals to
      Cendwar in the event of some catastrophic emergency.

      Troops carry medallions that notify their generals of death of the troops
      from afar. The troops themselves can also be signaled for withdrawal with
      the medallions. The medallion changes from a gentle blue to a deep yellow
      when the troop is being summoned. It is no surprise that the elven army
      calls their troops "Bel'heldin" - roughly "sky-fighters" in the common
      tongue, and the generals are "Val'Genier", or "seeing suns".

      If "Bel'heldin" sounds familiar to you, it is because "Bel'aheldan"
      itself translates into common as "People of the sky", "Moon shone ones",
      or "Star children" depending on the inflection.

      To be high elf of Bel'aheldan is to be elevated, wise, connected with

      :END:

      Bel'aheldan have houses devoted to the various schools of magic, and
      some houses whose specialty is either divine or of some non-scholastic
      arcane source. Houses can be thought of as loose affiliations of
      families who share interest in the same sorts of discoveries. The
      reality is much more complex than that, but it's a good place to start.
      Houses all must devote a share of their populace to guard or patrol
      duty. The most common patrols are for Tentaku to keep the orcs from
      making incursions. The patrols themselves can address small amounts of
      orcs on their own, but anything larger and they call upon the
      Bel'heldin. Contributing to army functions are a way for a house lacking
      in magical accomplishments to earn some prestige. In the past, the less
      prestigious houses were underrepresented in Bel'aheldanii affairs, and
      so houses resorted to toxic extremes to earn recognition and therefore
      power amongst their peers.

      Today, Bel'aheldan ensures that all houses can only go so far with their
      prestige. Instead prestigious positions are managed by multiple houses,
      and a house may only have so many dignitaries.

      The Bel'aheldanii do not covet magical knowledge for their sole use, and
      freely share it. Some of the best dwarven architects are known to study
      a great deal amongst these elves. This is so they can use enchanted
      materials to do more with their structures.

      In its darker times, there was less regulation on what kinds of magics
      were studied, and houses contended more fiercely for honor and
      recognition amongst their ranks. The combination of these things has led
      to Bel'aheldan's greatest disasters - such as fiendish incursions and a
      nation-wide spell cast upon every citizen within its borders.

      Exploration of the weave is kept in check today as well. Magical studies
      require researchers from at least three houses are participating in the
      study.

       The elves and orcs have a long standing hatred. There are no embassies
       amongst these lands. Bel'aheldan has taken up the mantle of being the
       first line of defense in orcish incursion. Along the southern borders
       of Tentaku are Bel'aheldanii patrols. The eastern border and lake of
       Toadslick is held by Bel'aheldanii. Nomasgard used to hold the land,
       but when orcs broke through and circled into elven territory through a
       relatively unguarded border, it was deemed that Bel'aheldanii would
       hold jurisdiction there. Nomasgard bolsters Tentaku's eastern front
       with troops of their own. Many trackers and scouts receive their
       training alongside the elves. It is a strong symbol of the alliance of
       the two nations, and rumored to be the result of most half elves born
       out of Duranae. Here the elves do all the teaching, because as we all

       Minheimia contributes to southeastern patrols, and fill gaps in the
       Bel'aheldanii defenses as needed. This is out of sense of kindred and
       hatred of orcs in equal parts. Though there are writings indicating
       that Bel'aheldan and Minheimia were both a single nation, but the high
       elves lorded over their more nature-bound cousins. The wood elves
       claimed second class citizenry, and were considered subjugated. Some of
       the oldest wood elves compare it to outright slavery. The ancient
       members of the Bel'aheldanii claim it was for their protection and
       welfare. Both can agree that wood elves departed to the east and stood
       in a line that marks the Bel'aheldanii-Minheimian border today. Then
       they did the most absurd thing; they stared at each other for 3 days
       and 3 nights. At which point they parted, and Minheimia has been its
       own sovereign nation since then.

       The foundation of Minheimia is considered mythical as much of the other
       elves' ancient history. There is evidence of heavy conflict in
       Bel'aheldan's soil. Shallow graves, armor and weapons left with the
       bodies, and ruins of towns that never got rebuilt litter Bel'aheldan
       everywhere, not in any relation to the Bel'aheldanii-Tentakish border.
       There are some records that indicate Bel'aheldan entered a time called
       "The Blight of Devils", which suggests one side or another employed
       infernal powers long ago - probably for the civil war itself.

       If elves wouldn't lean so hard on their symbolism maybe we'd know the
       real truth.

       Elves forget slowly, and for generations to stop passing on their
       inherited hatreds takes much longer than the rest of us, but there are
       signs of healing. Minheimia lends its scouts and naturalists to aid the
       Bel'aheldan borders with Tentaku.

       The melting pot nation of Nomasgard share a close alliance with
       Bel'aheldan. Duranae's use of magic in the city's foundation itself
       has attracted the high wizards of Bel'aheldan since the nations have
       recorded history of each other. Nomasgard's arcanists similarly
       frequent to the capital of Cendwar to delve into more magical secrets.

       Wizards from both cities can easily afford the teleportation fees.

       Nomasgard and Bel'aheldan share defensive duties amongst Tentaku's
       southeastern borders. Both elven blade and bow-work are passed onto the
       troops there, and combative casters can put their magical theories to
       the test. Can you imagine how dangerous magical studies would be if
       they were practiced indoors with nothing but the citizenry nearby? I
       shudder to think of the property damage.

      The chief export of Bel'aheldan is magic - in a sense. Wizards can be
      chartered to perform great magical acts, give advice on arcane matters,
      create magical artifacts, and some suggest the capture and storage of
      weapons too powerful for individuals or even nations to responsibly
      bear.

      In turn Bel'aheldan seeks magics to supplement their own arts. The state
      itself pays handsomely for moonstone. Officials whisper when there is
      enough moonstone accumulated to have a statue of every high elf, all the
      high elves will depart the realm and take on a new form that is one of
      raw magic, and they shall live in the weave itself.

     The elven nation of Minheimia takes its name from the elvish "minhela",
     meaning "unshackled", "unbridled", or even "unsaddled", and the "eimia"
     part of the name means "stand of" in common, but backwards because it's
     elvish. Minheimia claims to have splintered from Bel'aheldan in a civil
     war that - I can't make this up - ended with all of the wood elves and
     high elves staring at each other at what is now the border between the
     two, and not a drop of blood.

      Minheimia is a beautiful land with lush grasslands broken by dense
      forests with proud trees. Spire Fur trees grow to enormous heights and
      cast out wide branches. Much of the forests, including the capital of
      Kep Aelar itself, are covered by a canopy that leaves everything dark,
      like a deep overcast without the gloom. At least most of the time. Some
      places in those forests instill some primal fear - like every branch is
      an outreached arm, and every shadow conceals eyes that stare upon you
      with dreadful malice.

      Even the mountains to Minheimia's eastern side are covered in lush
      plant life. The Ring River between Minheimia and Nomasgard is said to
      look like moving glass.

      In my travels, I never found a farm of any kind. No fields, no fenced
      areas, and no obviously domesticated animals. The Minheimians truly live
      in harmony with the land.

      lack of privacy. The wood elves are an open people and either sleep
      under the stars or the trees. Some have dirt or leaf litter for
      flooring. Generally if some elves want a private conversation, they
      either go for a walk or write in the dirt to one another.

      One structure of note is the arena of Kep Aelar, which suggests a savage
      side to the wood elves, in keeping with their close bond to nature.

       Records exist of a war when the simple southwester folk of Nomasgard
       began a lumbering project that went unchecked. Though still Nomasgard
       territory, the scout-trackers of Minheimia learned of this and began
       humiliating the lumberjacks of the area. Humiliation then turned to
       injury. Eventually injury gave way to death. A war was started.
       Nomasgardian forces were dispatched, and though blood was shed on both
       sides, Nomasgard shed the most. In an act of frustration the forces
       were split and went to set fire to the trees as a way of injuring the
       elves. The original lumber project was forgotten, and only vengeance
       was what the humans had appetite for. The wood elves record that,
       without any prompting on their end, gnomes of the local area -
       presumably living in or under these trees - baffled the humans with
       illusions and caused the humans to set fire to their own crops! The
       humans eventually learned to touch a tree before burning it. The elves
       surrendered to spare a forest that wasn't even theirs. The Nomasgard
       general was a practical one, and conscripted the elves to help them
       push the borders of Tentaku back on the Nomasgard front. They
       accomplished their goal, but all of the scout-trackers perished.

       Today Minheimia and Nomasgard live in peace and have better outlines of
       territory and respect for the land. A descendant of the general gave
       the land won by the scout-trackers to Minheimia. Nomasgard forces hold
       it to this day, but Minheimians are considered sovereigns to that odd
       spec of territory. Some of the relatives of the scout-trackers travel

       Gazgren is far from the bulk of Minheimia, but the grave sites near
       Tentaku are not. The hatred of orcs and elves is well known enough for
       a silly goblin to tell you. The hobgoblins planned an ambush for the
       main remembrance day at the grave site, and upon executing it were able
       to capture all of the elves there. Just as their relatives were pushed
       to conscription, so too were these elves compelled by the goblinoids to
       fight for territory and spoils for the goblinoid armies. They initially
       performed well, and earned much trust from the goblinoids from
       consistent results. The hogoblin commanders promised freedom once the
       next camp was taken, but the promise was remade again for yet another
       camp, and so on. Not being a group of just scout-trackers, these
       elves were able to fool the hobgoblins into approaching an orc
       stronghold thinking its defenders dead and spoils ready for the taking.
       The orcs thought themselves to be reinforced by a neighboring tribe
       that was weaker and understood who was really in charge. Both parties
       were caught by surprise when the veil was removed. Inside the camp the
       fight was brutal. The few survivors were swiftly dispatched by the wood
       elves, and they razed the camp. A war wagon piled with orc ears and
       hobgoblin heads was found deserted in Gazgren's territory just outside
       of Tentaku. The hogoblins received the message that the elves would not
       be used in such a way again.

       that help watch Tentaku's easter fronts, and watch over their burial
       shrines. That area is technically under Minheimia's jurisdiction, but
       Nomasgard bolsters its forces and the Nomasgardians sent there benefit
       from training of how to live off the land, scout unseen, and talk to
       chipmunks.

       The elves would never allow me to journey with them, but I was able to
       present myself as a transfer to the Nomasgardian troop posted there. I
       learned how to find berries! I am unsure why Nomasgard continues to

     The star Valan comes from the elven word for "judge". Every 43 years the
     star grows to take up a size that is about a quarter of the moon. The
     most peak time of it lasts for about one month, which the elves call
     "Sque valan"; elven for "judgment rendered" or "reparations", depending
     on the inflection. It is bright enough to leave a powerful deep red glow
     at night. Many of those races without darkvision can see and navigate
     freely during this time.

     It also has a unique property in that it has a baffling effect on
     creatures with darkvision. Their darkvision simply doesn't work in those
     30 or so days. The elves say that this is Valan coming to judge those
     arrogant enough to walk in the night.

     What's also interesting is that this effect applies even to things that
     are shielded from the light of Valan. Creatures that dwell underground
     cannot see at all and must rely upon other senses. Underground creatures
     fall into two rough categories: One is hibernation. For others, they go
     to the surface. This makes for a very chaotic time indeed! Most civilized
     regions have provisions and guards to handle this. Other, more remote
     areas will either go into their basements or temporarily seeks shelter in
     places that do have defenses. In Gyoro, it is a capital offense to refuse
     shelter to any of the goodly races during this 30 day period.

     I used this time to move about the forests of Minheimia and witness some
     of the most debased acts that druidic circles perform. It is one of my
     saucier essays that I highly recommend!

     each other, narrowly miss, and then fling each other way. This absurdity
     should be dismissed outright. Clearly you can see that Valan is present
     only at night, and our sun only present at day.

     There are historic paintings that show Valan side by side with the sun
     during the day. This is assured to be the artistry of a lunatic though!

     Valan drifts across the sky over the course of a year, and is gone for

     The tribes-people of Egalstan remember where Valan was when they were born
     and prescribe characteristics to themselves. They use this to determine
     compatibility during courtship, among other things.

     Nomasgard sends troops of its armies to known caves and builds fires to
     lure out creatures that are otherwise blind to everything else. This
     becomes a killing field, and many trophies are gathered during this time.
     It's considered a sort of reward for many soldiers, and a way to blend
     different units together to trade stories, techniques, drinks, and to even
     "work off steam". Though no steam is produced. I am sorry to say, my
     friend, I was not able to find any dealings with steam in my readings or
     talking to elders of this affair. I shall endeavor to be of strong mind
     and health for my next Sque Valan so I can report back more!

     The orcs of Tentaku believe Valan to be the eye of Gruumsh coming closer
     to see that the orcs are worthy. This incites them to aggressive action.
     Armies are said to repel their attacks, but many, sneakier orcs manage to
     slip by and wreak havoc in the bergs behind the army lines. Even with a
     chaotic countryside, the orcs numbers dwindle rapidly from losses of
     fighting. After Valan recedes, those near Tentaku celebrate.

     Gazgren's goblinoids do the opposite of the orcs, and will set aside their
     internal differences. Leaders of the legions dine with one another and
     speak of greater conquests for Maglubiyet. The years that follow are
     sorrowful for Gazgren's neighbors.

     The elves of Bel'aheldan use this time to get in more meditation time and
     self reflect upon the last 43 years. They make new resolutions to better
     themselves, or begin a new task. Some will use this time to more deeply
     explore their romance lives. Many of their tales of love center around
     this time. But elven romance novels are so boring! They just stare at each
     other for pages and pages!

     The rugged people of Vyxt use Sque Valan to hunt great beasts that trouble
     their lands, or could trouble their parched lands, for that matter.

     As mentioned earlier, the druidic rites of Sque Valan for the Minheimians
     are quite debased. I have gone into greater detail in my __Eithics and

    Golani Grumsvelt's __Hirelings are Forever__ contains a lot of useful

    vengeance; all for reasons that seem to baffle Grumsvelt.

**** origins

     :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--origins
     :END:
     It is commonly known that the nation of Vyxt is a majority of dragonborn
     citizens. Legend has it that this was at one point the home of dragons.
     Vyxt is syntactically very close to the draconic word "vyskarix", which
     closely translates to "home" in the common tongue. The dragons would
     fight amongst each other and their losses became great. The dragons
     agreed to leave each other alone and allow lesser creatures to handle
     their squabbles while the dragons bathed in piles of riches in peace.

     If you believe that pile of rubble, let me go on: It is said that Tiamat,
     the evil queen of dragons, birthed the first kobolds by hatching her eggs
     prematurely. Tiamat's estranged lover, Bahamut, had sequestered some of
     the same eggs for himself, and incubated the dragonborn from them. Both
     races spread across the land of Vyxt, and brought riches to their dragon
     lords as homage. Happy dragons meant intact villages.

     At some point, a powerful red dragon backed by a conniving green dragon
     and a devious blue dragon positioned themselves as the most powerful
     dragons of Vyxt. From there they claimed rulership over the dragonborn,
     and the world itself entered a dark age.

     The dragonborn clans, for both better and worse, boast their lineage back
     to such times. Many clans allied themselves to the chromatic dragons and
     benefited greatly. Some worked in secret to help eventually overthrow the
     chromatic dragons. Today the dragonborn clans don't see things as allies
     of good and evil as you and I might see it. Instead the clans aligned
     with chromatics are seen as loyal, yet simple. The clans aligned against
     the chromatics are seen as intelligent, but scheming. There are of course
     exceptions and these sweeping generalizations primarily exhibit
     themselves when dragonborn gossip much like those in Egalstan do about
     the phase of the red star they were born under. It also comes out in
     ceremonies between the nobles of the dragonborn courts. The traits of a
     clan are used as a kind of honorific, and those traits are said to hail
     back to an age when the dragons ruled, and the dragonborn were but
     servants to the dragons.

     The dragonborn courts are a sight to behold. Everything that is dragonborn
     is impressively big. Their ceilings rise high, and tapestries must be
     equally long. The artisanship lacks the flare you see in the sturdy
     dwarven stonework or fine elven ornaments.

     The royalty of Vyxt allowed me to sit in on their court proceedings and a
     aspiring ambassador explained all of the nuances to me. It was a very
     straightforward affair. Usually I have to sneak in and remain hidden for
     these sorts of things! Although I will say, dragonborn court servants make
     lousy grape peelers. They just gave them to me mashed!

**** titles

     :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--titles

     When using charms and other lures to get a loose tongue, the Vyxtians
     warm up fastest with proper use of their clan titles than exotic trinkets
     or the sounds of coins rubbing together.

     When speaking to each other their clan heritage comes out in formal,
     structured ways that give respects to the formally acknowledge strengths
     of the clan. Dragonborn use a subtle pre-title as a means of indicating
     peacefulness or goodwill, and it is always respectful. For example, The
     Scherix clan is known to be fair. The honorific form of Scherix is "Fair
     Scherix" in the common tongue. Dragonborn even love it when their clan
     honorific is used in another tongue such as common. It gives them a
     little flavor over their one-word complement they receive by showing its
     various subtleties and color from other languages. To show even a common
     dragonborn their honorific when addressing them never goes unnoticed.

     To use the dragonborn clan's negative honorific is to be abrasive,
     insulting, or even aggressive in an imminent way. Like the positive
     honorific, it never goes unnoticed, and is never spoken in jest, no matter
     how familiar you might be with the dragonborn or their clan. This leads to
     many conflicts with other races where respect and bonding is communicated
     in ways that are very complex to the dragonborn. Using our example of
     Scherix, they are known to be greedy. The negative honorific is "Greedy
     Scherix".

     If you try to make up a negative honorific (like "Wasteful Scherix"), it's
     confusing and comes off as non-sequitur. While the dragonborn might
     understand that you're trying to insult them, the feeling of just how off
     your statement is will overpower that, generally.

     Leaving off an honorific has an interesting interaction. Dragonborn are
     very direct in their social dealings. Leaving off the honorific in their
     clan name means you know their clan, but you don't wish to honor or
     dishonor it. You don't really wish anything with it at all. It
     communicates an indifference that other races might be insulted by. For
     dragonborn it simply means you have no immediate desire to strengthen a
     relationship with them (friend or foe). It's generally used when
     communicating with strangers or talking about trade matters.

     have quite a racket going on, creating baubles behind their shops and
     talking about how they come from some forgotten age! Bah! But the stories
     sound good. I managed to procure some and plan on taking the stories with
     me to Duranae to fetch a handy sum. I might be on to them, but I can't
     blame them, can I?
**** food

     :END:

     Dragonborn are hulking, brutish creatures and have monstrous appetites
     compared to the other goodly races. Vyxt's primary import is food, and
     for their own food it tends to be primarily meat. Meat is the filler
     ingredient in their dishes, with other nutrients being wrapped or stuffed
     in the meat almost apologetically. Vyxt's deserts don't leave much
     fertile land for tilled fields and wheat. Instead Vyxtian farms are
     mostly for raising indigenous desert livestock, such as any large
     serpents, also small serpents, cows, goats, pigs, and rarely giant
     insects. It's not uncommon for Vyxtian ranchers to be skilled warriors
     out of necessity of their trade.

     I highly recommend pork-wrapped viper sauteed in (giant) scorpion venom.
     As a national delicacy goes, it does not disappoint! It should be noted
     that elves might want to try a different dish, due to the hallucinogenic
     properties of the venom on elven physiology. This is no recreational
     hallucinogen but instead tends to provoke violent actions from the
     consumer.

     Clans pay the state in tithe of recruits for soldiers. Soldiers hold a
     lot of honor amongst the dragonborn, and even a retired veteran is
     held in a baseline reverence.

     All aspects of the Vyxt armies involve some kind of magical assault.
     Scouts learn both simple spells to move faster or help themselves remain
     hidden. The rank and file troops learn simple attack spells or even
     spells that augment their brute strength. Shock troops pick up defensive
     spells that make their forms hard to make out, or minor teleportation
     spells to get in and out quickly. Drake riders learn spells that anchor
     their flying prey so the ground units can finish them off. Even the lowly
     gate wall guards learn spells of compulsion and detection to spot thieves
     and contraband; Though they did use this to determine I had fine nymphish
     pipeweed on hand and confiscated it! I had intended to use that pipeweed
     to give to the general. It would've relaxed her to the point of letting
     me see how their mysterious black claws operate.

     :END:

     The citizens of Vyxt are hardy, strong, and proud. They lack many of the
     creature comforts you and I know of. For them, life is a trial to prove
     oneself. They are less likely to use contraptions and devices to make
     life easier. However Vyxt invests much in sorcerous studies. Unlike the
     utility and art of Bel'aheldanii magical works, Vyxtian magic is
     primarily studied for combat and those spells that promise high value in
     war are prioritized. Even in times of peace, the Vyxt believe that the
     next war is around the bend. Any dragonborn will tell you that casting
     off the dragon rule was a cost they don't wish to pay a second time.

     One should be careful about asking about such things. My assistant
     Valaria was fingered to the authorities and immediately detained by some
     of Bahamut's order. When dealing with strict authorities such as those in
     Vyxt, it is important to use proxies to gather information as I have.
     Imagine if I had my papers confiscated! Sometimes I wonder what happened
     to Valaria. She was always a clever conversationalist, and loyal to the
     end I am absolutely sure. Still, better to leave the area just in case.

**** religions
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--religions
     :END:

     The primary deities worshiped in Vyxt are Bahamut and Tiamat - the dragon
     gods of the pantheon. The dragonborn relationship with dragons is a
     complicated one. They hate the dragons for enslavement, but derive
     incredible pride in themselves and, as part of themselves, their draconic
     heritage. Dragons represent power to them; Sometimes terrible, and
     sometimes wonderful.

     While Tiamat is known to be a god of evil, the dragonborn see a
     practicality in that evil when it comes to war. In their view, killing is
     never a good thing, but it is sometimes (or oftentimes, depending on
     which dragonborn you're talking to) necessary. Instead of worshiping her
     for evil purposes, they instead venerate her aspect of vengeance and
     wealth - to match the needs of war and the benefit of spoils from that
     war. In the mind of a Vyxtian, leaving the spoils is just wasteful, and
     even disrespectful to the dead. Paladins of Tiamat are employed as
     warrior-generals of their armies, and an order of them comprises one kind
     of their elite strike forces.

     Bahamut is revered by almost all nobles. His followers comprise most of
     the churches of healing, and their holy knights help police internal
     affairs of Vyxt. If there is a traitor in their midst, the holy knights
     of Bahamut work tirelessly to root them out. Bahamut's holy knights can
     detect magical auras and even sense lies. It is important to gather the
     unfettered truth when compiling these works of mine. To evade these
     powers it is good to be in a place where a magical aura already exists,
     or be ready to create your own with blessed holy water or druidic
     berries - items which seem innocent enough but baffle such detection. I
     have heard other writers carry a talking doll or illusory pocket
     paintings to ensure the schools of magic shown are expected. Rest assured
     that my techniques are much more advanced than these ideas that were
     surely thought up on a short wagon ride.

     Worshipers from both sides accept Bahamut and Tiamat's relationship as a
     complex one, much as the dragonborn themselves have a complex
     relationship with dragons. Worshipers of one dragon deity will show
     respect and sometimes even act in partnership with the deity of the
     other.

     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--external-affairs
     :END:

     The most immediate neighbors of Vyxt are the dwarves of Glintstrad and
     the humans of Cyorro. Their histories together are mottled with wars over
     resources. There is a friendly relationship with Nomasgard, and a niche
     one with Bel'aheldan. Other nations are too far or too unconcerned with
     Vyxt to be of great interest to the nation as a whole.
***** Glintstrad

      :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--external-affairs--glintstrad
      :END:

      One such war was fought mostly underground - the dwarves had dug their
      tunnels far into Vyxtian territory and they happened upon preserved
      dragon hordes from ancient times. The dwarves had pilfered much by the
      time the horde-guards had spotted them. The Vyxt do not act kindly when
      one uses a pick to pry the gemstones out of their history. While the
      dwarves were in their primary terrain, the dragonborn were fighting with
      a cause they felt righteous. The dwarves were beaten back and they left
      empty handed. Today there is a treaty in place declaring clearly that
      the borders between the two extend underground as well. Maps have been
      drawn showing such caverns. Though one expects such boundaries are hard
      to enforce, and a dwarf would be a fool to call out for Vyxtian guards
      upon arriving in a large dragon horde and the owner nowhere to be seen.

      :END:
      Long ago, Cyorro was duped by a clever dragon into laying siege to an
      area of worthless sand in Vyxt territory. The dragonborn didn't put up
      much of a fight for that area, and lost much territory in this process.
      Today Cyorro has offered some of that land back in reparation, but the
      spoils are gone forever - probably hidden near the basements and attics
      of many a warrior's inheritors. Legend has it that the dragon sought a
      dark green orb with power to bring back the dead or capture souls for
      strange and mostly unknown soul magic. I just wish I could blame a
      crafty green dragon for anything the dragonborn authorities didn't like!

      :END:
      Across the Valiant Sea, Nomasgard is the closest sea-based state to
      Vyxt, and much trading is done there instead of traversing Glintstrad -
      depending on where the good are coming from. Nomasgard, Glintstrad, and
      Vyxt all donate a pool of patrol fleets, which are even cross-staffed
      between the nations of Nomasgard and Glintstrad. Still, Vyxt keeps a
      navy of its own. Self sufficiency is vital to the dragonborn, and they
      view slavery in many forms - alliances and politics potentially being
      another kind.

***** Pirates

      :CUSTOM_ID: dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--external-affairs--pirates
      :END:

      Dragonborn pirates operate large vessels instead of smaller and faster
      ones. They are escorted by a convoy and while they can't always catch
      trade ships, they can corral their victims or even take on lightly
      guarded trade ships. The navies usually can only track such ships from
      their smaller reconnaissance vessels. Any good dragonborn captain will
      have a sorcerer onboard to hide its location or even completely relocate
      the ship. This keeps the pirates at large and still having much larger
      ships for large hauls and a sort of base of operations from which other
      pirates strike out.

      It is said an order of dragonborn is maintained who seek wizardry from
      the elves of Bel'aheldan. Not all dragonborn can easily harness their
      dragonic heritage for sorcerous powers. However, the costs of such a
      journey for an individual are many, especially for a lone trip. Typically
      only the nobility can afford the trips, let alone the steep costs of such
      tutelage. These warrior-wizards are said to be represented in every
      clan - a way of stating that the dragonborn embrace their draconic
      heritage by choice rather than necessity.
