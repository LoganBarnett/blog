I won&rsquo;t willingly use Windows - not for development work, or any real work if I
can help it.  I won&rsquo;t work at a workplace that requires its software engineers
to use Windows.  I actively recommend that people don&rsquo;t work at workplaces that
require their software engineers use Windows.  I will explain why.

This article is going to be a little subjective.  Windows can literally do
everything I will outline by virtue of being able to run a virtual machine with
the OS that does the job.  But if we&rsquo;re talking about the virtues of an OS, what
it readily affords, and what you have to do in order to accomplish certain
tasks, saying your operating system can run another operating system (they all
can), isn&rsquo;t really saying anything useful.  At some point a line must be drawn
on what a thing is good at and bad at, and understand there will be edge cases.

This is not a hate document towards Microsoft or its Windows operating system.
I wish to deliver what I believe are articulated and well thought out reasons

person exclaiming that they hate Windows, but only later.  Know that this is not

<h2 id="a-history-with-microsoft"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> A History with Microsoft</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-a-history-with-microsoft">
<p>
I know Microsoft wants to do better - to embrace open source and get onto a more
accessible model.  Microsoft highly values the throng of users stuck on older
versions of the software, and people slow to change.  It&rsquo;s their base, so it
makes sense for them to do so.
</p>

<p>
My wariness comes from a history where I have observed a pattern.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft attempts some really interesting and exciting things.  Here&rsquo;s a
sampling:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using the XBox One, Microsoft made a sincere attempt at creating a successful
version of the Steambox.  Steam has pushed hard for a Steambox - a Linux based
gaming platform.  They&rsquo;ve gotten many video games to support &ldquo;Steam Play&rdquo;,
which is their sticker of approval saying the game runs on Linux, macOS, and
Windows.  The idea differs from one of exchanging media discs which eventually
wear out or break, and require book-case like representation in a media room
for storage.  Instead it favors downloading the game directly onto the
device&rsquo;s storage, where loading times will be much faster and you needn&rsquo;t
worry about how someone smudges your precious copy of Halo in the act of
putting it back in its case.  The distribution model has worked great for
Steam, though Steam didn&rsquo;t seem to hit the mark very well with the Steambox.</li>
<li>OData existed before GraphQL.  It was kind of an attempt at standardizing the
REST &#x2026;protocol? which even today remains to be a kind of zone of
lawlessness.  REST is generally considered to be a good thing, but it is
incomplete.  This is why every language has an &ldquo;API&rdquo; for various popular
RESTful APIs.  We all kind of understand it but we can&rsquo;t easily get away with
a universal &ldquo;REST consumer&rdquo; because the nature of REST is such a thing cannot
exist.  OData provided a very standardized means of programmatic discovery for
a REST API, as well as a standardized query mechanism for getting data.</li>
<li>The Surface tablet suggested a rise of touch screen laptops and so with their
shiny new hardware Microsoft set out to embrace this predicted market trend
with Windows 8&rsquo;s tiles and charms.  This is Windows&rsquo; new way of embracing a
touch interface, where the interface favors a series of controls on the left
and right of the screen (where your thumbs would go, if you were grasping a
large touch-screen laptop).</li>
<li>The Holo Lens is an augmented reality (AR) headset, providing a wide spectrum
of view.  Put these glasses on, and the software provides a visual overlay on
top of what you&rsquo;re seeing in the outside world.  You could potentially see
your bus approaching your stop even though buildings obstructed your view.
You could discover points of interest that are normally very difficult to find
due to the layout of streets and buildings, or even find people in a crowded
social event.  AR has a lot of potential for many more use cases, and the Holo
Lens is perhaps the first serious attempt at embracing it.</li>
<li>.Net came out a while ago, but I&rsquo;m old enough to remember the announcement.
It had the promise of a much better iteration of Java.  The language would be
better, and just like Java, it would be cross platform, and many languages
would compile down to a common byte code.</li>
<li>Microsoft developed Powershell, a retake on the shells of old.  Shells like
<code>bash</code> would hold no candle to Powershell, whose model of information was
&ldquo;objects&rdquo; or perhaps better thought of as records.  This would mean you
wouldn&rsquo;t need to do text chopping as is done <code>bash</code> to do something like
select a column of data.  It would be a far improvement over Microsoft&rsquo;s own
<code>batch</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Interesting things, yeah? So here&rsquo;s where <span class="underline">they hurt me</span>, or at least
demonstrated a pattern that keeps me unwilling to give additional chances:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The XBox One backed away from using their online store, very late in the game.
This was done in response to a Sony Playstation video showing how easy it is
to loan one game to a friend.  This is an inherent trade-off of the
download-only model.  It&rsquo;s a bold vision to pursue but Microsoft didn&rsquo;t stick
their guns.  They went back to the prior disc model, and so console video
games remain as they have since the advent of old Commodore 64 cartridges: You
must have some detachable media to play games.  That media is prone to faults
and losing that media means you&rsquo;ve lost your investment.</li>
<li>OData allowed arbitrary <code>POST</code> actions for times when REST didn&rsquo;t seem to do
the trick.  In that way OData became a slave to two masters.  Having software
try to do more than one thing is often a mortal wound.  That was its death to
me.  I don&rsquo;t know if it fell into neglect or if these accommodations had
similar impact on others.  In any case, giants like Netflix who were using
OData stopped using OData.  Nowadays if you want the promised benefits of
OData, you reach for GraphQL, which seems to be on the rise based on my wet
finger raised to the winds.</li>
<li>Windows 8 really riled some feathers.  The tile stuff didn&rsquo;t make sense to
non-touch-screen laptops, and not everyone went out an bought a new laptop
(let alone a touch screen laptop) to jump into the new hotness of Windows 8.
Windows 8 didn&rsquo;t seem to intelligently understand it was running on a touch
screen device, and so it really got a lot of backlash.  Windows 8.1 hid the
tiles as an opt-in feature.  We still see some remnants of it in modern
iterations of Windows&rsquo; new UIs, but with nobody designing their applications
with it in mind, it might as well be vestigial.</li>
<li>The Holo Lens came out of the prototype phase with an incredibly limited field
of view.  Discovering information by sweeping your vision would be more like
scanning crowded streets through a keyhole (a bit of an exaggeration, but the
point stands).</li>
<li>.Net did fulfill its promise of being cross language, and it did pull people
over from Visual Basic.  However everyone just uses C#.  Not even Unity could
get people to use UnityScript for anything serious - today C# and .Net are
fairly synonymous in terms of usage.  If you&rsquo;re doing things with .Net, you&rsquo;re
using C# to do it.  C# isn&rsquo;t bad as object oriented languages go, but cross
language usage is a vestigial feature now.  Perhaps it could be considered a
net win still: Java has taken strides to support other languages in its byte
code (mimicry is flattery) and pulling away VB6 programmers into the C# world
is generally considered to be a good thing.  A more definite disappointment
was .Net&rsquo;s cross platform support.  Cross platform in this case simply meant
&ldquo;It runs on all versions of Windows&rdquo; - not exactly what I had in mind.  A
rogue project called Mono, tied up with the now-dead Novell, made an
implementation that ran on other platforms.  Over a decade later the
implementation was eventually subsumed into official .Net land.  But generally
if you&rsquo;re doing .Net you&rsquo;re doing Windows, with C#.</li>
<li>Powershell was released as part of the Windows operating system, disabled by
default, and requiring some complicated and scary operations to run.  This
immensely hurts Powershell as it means scripting authors can&rsquo;t rely on it
being enabled.  It increases the barrier to entry to folks who are less risk
adverse or people who are virtually already system administrators for Windows
itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To me all of this points to a horse that oftentimes gets to the finish line
before any other horse, but seems to always do some kind of face plant right
before it crosses.  I don&rsquo;t see this as a platform of stability, or one that
enables me to flourish as someone who want the computer to work for me instead
of me working for the computer.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-technical-considerations--the-model-of-unix">
<p>
Or POSIX, or Linux, or *nix, or whatever we need to call it.
</p>

<p>
A good model is worth its weight in <code>$precious_metal</code>, and has been proven in
the software industry to make that software keep going for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix#History">half a century or
more</a>.  One such model in this ecosystem which will be covered is how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">everything is a file</a>.  Let&rsquo;s dive into this for a moment.
</p>

<p>
In POSIX, everything is a file.  Generally we think of files as blobs of data,
and we can use programs to view or manipulate those files.  However the model of
&ldquo;everything is a file&rdquo; goes deeper than that.  Files in POSIX are better
described as a named entity in which you can read from and write to - and that&rsquo;s
about it.  That could map to some location in storage like we traditionally
think about it, but it also can include hardware (disks, serial ports, network
ports, even CPUs or displays).
</p>

<p>
Files can also be the processes themselves.  Think about the meaning of that: If
you can write to a file, and a file can be a process, that means you can write
to a process.  What does that mean? That means I can communicate with a process
by sending it data through a well-known mechanism (file writing).  I don&rsquo;t need
some special API to make this happen - it&rsquo;s a notion built into the model of the
entire operating system.  Every process has a <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> which are
inputs and outputs.  We can write to a processes&rsquo; input as well as read from its
output.  This allows us to compose lots of small programs together to achieve
powerful effects.  The composition mechanism is well understood and incredibly
flexible.  It doesn&rsquo;t demand bespoke mechanisms that an unstandardized model
would bring about.
</p>

<p>
Windows has some mechanisms that kind of mimic the composition seen in POSIX.
These piped redirections will allow you to do some amount of composition, but
the fact that devices are not also files that you can simply read/write, much of
it is lost.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the file model seen in POSIX isn&rsquo;t the only model it uses.  There are
others, but I have not observed Windows using these.  Generally developing
software on Windows requires monolithic software constructs.  APIs rule that
landscape.  I don&rsquo;t want APIs - they are contrary to composition.

<h3 id="technical-considerations--hostility-towards-software-development"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Hostility towards Software Development</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-technical-considerations--hostility-towards-software-development">
<p>
Windows is actively hostile to software development, and this is quick and easy
to prove.  In Windows, the only out-of-box scripting you can do is with <code>cmd</code>,
and JavaScript you load with Microsoft Edge.  Granted, you can start installing
things to achieve more.  However, these programs have their limits.  Most parts
of Windows are governed by DLLs or other programs.  These entities require APIs
to access.  Compare this to Linux and macOS, where virtually every setting is
governed by a text file somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Since the advent of Powershell, Microsoft has been pushing for more command line
tools to access things.  This is a mistake (though not exclusively Microsoft&rsquo;s):
Requiring programs to change things is, once again, introducing bespoke APIs.
Learning how to edit one program&rsquo;s settings doesn&rsquo;t position you to be any
better at editing another program&rsquo;s settings.  Whereas learning to manipulate
text carries over to every other text file.
</p>

<p>
Every time you click on something, an automation fairy dies.  The mouse is not
an easily automated device.  Programs in Windows are generally built with a GUI
first, which means the ability automate them is an afterthought.  The GUI is a
curated experience over the data it operates upon - your data.  Without tooling
to use the programs as you see fit (instead the tooling keeps you in a sort of
prison), you are unable to compose programs together.  You cannot make one
program&rsquo;s usefulness easily extend to another&rsquo;s.  Instead the program must
directly support the functionality you desire.  This keeps you beholden to that
program&rsquo;s feature support.  This is not how you have software that endures the
ages, and it hinders your ability automate (thus script), which is a core
capability of software development.

Much in the same way that I have steered away budding software engineers from
PHP because of the <a href="https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">systemically broken nature of it</a>, I steer away those same
engineers from working at Windows based workplaces.  The <a href="#technical-considerations">3</a> builds why I think Windows is individually a bad choice.
</p>

<p>
When I interview a candidate and I see you&rsquo;ve been spending time in a Windows
workplace, it will guide many of my interview questions.  It&rsquo;s a smell or red
flag, not an automatic deal breaker for me (although it may be for some).  I
will craft questions that tease out the candidate&rsquo;s ability to automate things,
and when they automated things, how they went about it.  I want to confirm my
suspicion: Their muscle for automation has atrophied, or was never there.
</p>

<p>
The same can be said for their ability model things - a highly sought after
skill for a software engineer.  If the candidate can&rsquo;t even appreciate a good
model such as &ldquo;everything is a file&rdquo;, then that candidate is going to struggle
with my models which I try to keep in a similar principle.
</p>

<p>
Clearly I paint with broad stokes here.  Will I encounter PHP and Windows
engineers who surprise me? I&rsquo;m sure I will.  However I don&rsquo;t consider the
numbers to be in their favor for any given engineer to be that person.  With new
candidates comes a lot of guesswork and extrapolation - a very imperfect
process.  But I must use <span class="underline">something</span>.

<p>
Arguably there are infinite things to learn.  However we have infinite time to
learn them, and while we shouldn&rsquo;t use that as an excuse to learn things, we
should use it as an means to decide which things to learn.  Sure, you could
straddle the Unix and Windows worlds.  But why not learn Lambda Calculus?
Category Theory? New, shiny languages? <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Fad server hosting</a>? Or even just go
deeper into Unix tools (you&rsquo;ll find the subject blossoms nicely).  For each year
you spend mastering Windows tech, you could&rsquo;ve also spent mastering some other
tech.
</p>

<p>
Impostor syndrome runs rampant in our industry.  You may think that a Windows
shop is the only place that will accept you.  I want to stress that the
interview process is highly arbitrary and lacks a standard.  Biases run
unchecked in this setting.  Unix based shops aren&rsquo;t turning you down because you
have failed - the number of reasons in which an applicant is turned down are
many.  Sometimes another person is seen as a better fit than you.  They might
not feel like they are capable of handling someone at your experience level (in
which case you lucked out).  Maybe you didn&rsquo;t fit some norm they have.  &ldquo;They
are the only ones that would hire me&rdquo; just rings false.
