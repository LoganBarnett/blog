This is a series of essays written in the voice of <a href="#dirshum--historic-characters--golani-grumsvelt">Golani Grumsvelt</a>, a
pompous and arrogantly privileged playboy. He tends to dismiss mythical

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--account-of-duranae">
<p>
Nicknamed &ldquo;Jewel of Dirshum&rdquo;, Duranae has established itself as a grand
intersection of being both a melting pot of cultures and a city that
prospers from all of the things our magical realm has to offer. It has a
population of roughly three million souls (determined through magical
scrying). Sitting in the middle of the world and a coastal city, it has an
advantaged position for trade. All walks of life can be found here, but it
is predominantly human in the populace. While the races do mix there, they
also tend to gather in their own burrows and neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s rumored
some of the dwarves of Dirshum never see the light of day, content to work
their trades in the areas below.
</p>

<p>
Duranae has a little bit of something for everyone, except for privacy of
course. It&rsquo;s a city you can easily disappear in, but you&rsquo;re never by
yourself no matter how alone you might feel.
</p>

<p>
Areas in Duranae can be rough 5 major sections. The outer city comprises the
farmlands. These are protected by the city watch, but aside from occasional
patrols this is more of a first-responder force. The farms provide some
sustenance for the city, but it is not nearly enough to sustain a population
of this magnitude. The primary crops consist of potatoes, wheat, and other
cheap-to-grow foods that are appropriate for the teeming masses.
</p>

<p>
As you move further into the city, before its walls, you will come across
its slums. These are hodge podge sheds and rickety dwellings that lean up
against the walls of Duranae. This is where the poorest of the poor live.
The city guards rarely patrol here, and those that do have a very cynical
outlook on life and their guard duties as well. EDIT: And let me tell you,
threatening me to divulge my sources is a criminal act! Or at least it
should be. I am your humble explorer - a cartographer of societies! Not a
study of the laws of just one city. But worry not Sheriff Vrot: Your guards
will still let me in the city if I make their pouches bulbous enough with
coin.
</p>

<p>
The third section, past the walls, is a place most people have been to and
think of when they mention Duranae. This is the middle quarter. It extends
from the walls marking the slums and farmlands all the way to the coast.
This is where the docks conduct their day to day affairs. Nomasgard has a
section of the docks devoted to its navy. Other parts of the docks are
closely connected to the bean counters of the trading guilds, and all goods
are carefully monitored and recorded. After seeing that, I wish I&rsquo;d
considered starting a lucrative venture in parchment making! There are also
less savory parts of the docks. The privateer wharfs is a very no
questions-asked kind of place. My brave assistants stood firmly to see and
record everything though. Only a total of three fingers were lost during
entire endeavor. I count that a success. Ah - one more notable thing: the
middle quarter of Duranae is a large, think ring. The middle is empty! But
that brings us to our next section.
</p>

<p>
The fourth section is the lower quarter. Some of it sees sunlight, but much
of it is underground. In the middle quarter, the cityscape will rapidly
transition downhill and end in a great lift. Here the goods from below come
up, and the supplies needed for the city&rsquo;s lower area go down. Many dwarves
live in the lower quarter, but it&rsquo;s not exclusive to them. Much of the
digging is done by kobolds that I am assured to be quite friendly, but sadly
I could not spare assistants that day to test this claim. The kobolds have
dug out much of the aqueducts, channels of lava flow for the forges, and
even much of the mining. The dwarves there claim it is shoddy work, but even
they admit the city rests easily upon all of it. I couldn&rsquo;t find a single
gnome there!
</p>

<p>
Going further up from the middle quarter is the fifth and final section: The
upper quarter. The upper quarter is a ring that is wider than Duranae&rsquo;s
middle quarter. This is the floating part of the city, suspended high above
the highest buildings in the middle quarter. The lift from the lower quarter
reaches all the way to the upper quarter. The center where the lift reaches
the height of the upper quarter is a series crystalline bridges that run to
the ring where the upper quarter proper is. All goods go through the
strictest of checks, and the guards here are well paid by the trade guilds
to ensure no bribery can ever work. Here is where you can find the finest
food, wines, clothing, and even the most beautiful of the goodly races, no
matter what your preferences are. There are many elves and gnomes here. Any
artisan with a valuable trade can make a go here. Every single dwelling here
has a view that stretches inwards to the below quarters or out into the
beautiful countryside or coast of Nomasgard, depending on where you rest
upon the ring.
</p>

<p>
My later chapters will cover arcane influences on Duranae, the religious
establishments, and law and crime. Duranae is such a rich and wonderful city
that also has many secrets and splendors - all you have to do is look!

<h4 id="dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--avandra's-smile">Avandra&rsquo;s Smile</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--avandra's-smile">
<p>
Taken from Golani Grumsvelt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Avandra&rsquo;s Smile&rdquo;, which was delayed in its
printing due to a strange goblin raid on the trade lines carrying inks:
</p>

<p>
Avandra has smiled upon all of us at one point or another in our lives.
Every time we attribute some favorable event as luck, we pay her a small
amount of reverence, and this sustains the goddess. Or so the priests of her
clergy tell me.
</p>

<p>
As part of our cataloging of the entire world of Duranae, we sometimes have
to do brave or absurd things. This time, bravery was not in high demand. We
entered as recent converts to a location I will not disclose today, and we
were able to learn much of the inner workings of the goddess and her
followers with an inside perspective.
</p>

<p>
The priests themselves are aloof and superstitious, and will attribute every
bloody sunny day in a summer to their goddess. They also carry around
sentimental trinkets that are unique to the individual, and they seem to
constantly fidget with it. You&rsquo;d think it were a holy symbol with how the
priests grasp them! The priests feel that avoiding bad luck is just another
form of good luck. As a result they do all kinds of things to avoid bad luck
that we heard as children: They only walk on the right side of a fountain,
they avoid crossing the path of a black cat, and sprinkle their doorways
with spices during the 13th day of the month. Between myself and my
assistants infiltrating their order, we mixed up which superstitions we
chose in advance, but nobody seemed to notice. They are just happy to see
other people saying everything is good or bad luck!
</p>

<p>
Temples of Avandra are established places in part because it is not easy to
have sacred grounds on the move. There have been attempts at wheeled temples
in the past, but they never proved out. Instead they settle on doing
frequent redecoration. Avandra is also an aspect of change. The temples are
very open places and the winds can be felt shifting about no matter where
you stand. At the center of this is a fountain and it&rsquo;s typically littered
with copper coins. The clergy cleans it out daily and uses the coins as
donations. What Avandra gives to those who toss coins in her fountains we
did not find out.
</p>

<p>
Many deities reinvest in the societies that invest in their own churches.
Avandra&rsquo;s is no different. She deeply invests in the arts, fashion, music.
Avandra&rsquo;s followers also run many orphanages. The orphanages are stinking
cesspits crowded with simple brats! I lost my best shoes to one of those
thieving curs! But it makes one realize just how relative luck can be for
these orphanages to be considered good fortune for someone.
</p>

<p>
Unless you&rsquo;ve suffered some kind of recent memory loss by an evil wizard,
you&rsquo;ll have heard &ldquo;Avandra smile upon you!&rdquo; or some similar statement. In
the common tongue this can show someone&rsquo;s eloquent upbringing and for the
masses it can sometimes be used facetiously.
</p>

<p>
Avandra&rsquo;s teachings guide us to live in the moment, take risks (fortune does
not come often at random but needs opportunity), and to ourselves be good
luck to others by readily offering help to any in need. As a result, she has
the most of her divinely blessed follows afield, manifesting good works in
her name. You&rsquo;d think she encourages all of them to buffoons about their
inert little trinkets as well, for as good as the clergy follow that
pattern.
</p>

<p>
Paladins of her order tend to favor longer weapons and lighter armor.
Bringing good luck in the form of help to others is the essence of these
martial priests. I saw one whose mount was a beautiful fey horse, which you
can learn about in my other book: Fey-folk of Duranae. Her less martial
followers dress very plainly for the road, but you can always pick them
apart by their wavy lined holy symbols and belts adorned with various good
luck charms.
</p>

<p>
Avandra opposes devils above all. The contract locks things in and is used
to restrict fortune in the future. It robs those in the contract of their
future consent and therefore their freedom to have a blessed life. Devils
encompass everything she hates about contracts and how the fine print always
seems to capture mortals. She spends a lot of effort trying to thwart their
plans, but as gods do not directly exert their will in our realm, it&rsquo;s very
easy for the devils to operate without much interference. Some things they
catch, but much slips past her watch. For that matter she finds non-devilish
contracts distasteful for the same reasons. I for one feel this is naive
even for a god. My contracts I&rsquo;ve established ensure I have a good and long
service from my assistants if they want to get paid. The turnover is very
high in my field!
</p>

<p>
Throughout history Avandra&rsquo;s power has waxed and waned. When she had a
disproportionate number of followers in the past, art flourished, gambling
institutions suffered, and rulers had a hard time keeping their thrones
under their rumps. When her followers dwindled, fashion stagnated, family
lines tended to keep their rule for generations, and people generally had a
sour outlook on their lives.
</p>

<p>
The last chosen of Avandra was a halfling named Rendil Fulburrow. It was
only revealed afterwards that he was a chosen, and he had no idea. Rendil,
simply put, is a fool that should have died long before history wrote his
name down. Every poor expense turned into some wonderful investment. Dangers
were diverted around him without his knowing, and he merrily strode along as
he did his &ldquo;long walk&rdquo; across the continent. He even wrote about his
travels, but even Avandra can&rsquo;t overcome the raw sales of my works! Quality
means something, my dear.
</p>

<p>
Avandra&rsquo;s relationships with the other gods is rather fleeting. In one
moment she will embrace Corellon as a the godly equivalent of a mate, and
other times they are all but enemies. It sounds like my third ex wife! Feel
free to pick up a copy of &ldquo;The Wives of Dirshum&rdquo; to broaden your views on
marriage.
</p>

<p>
Sehanine is an ally of Avandra and the priests attributed this to the
constant ebb and flow of the moon. This is utterly stupid. Changing
constantly is still a constant! The moon moves predictably. &ldquo;Charting
Dishum&rsquo;s Night&rdquo; covers this in great detail.
</p>

<p>
Avandra opposes Asmodeus most of all, with Bane a close second. Tyranny in
all of its forms is what she hates, and what those two bring about. It is
rumored that Avandra has specially appointed members of her church that hunt
down devil cults and slay them all before they grow too strong. Believe me
that these are myths, my friend. I have scoured our historical texts for
mass cultist slayings and on the rare occasion that it does happen, it&rsquo;s
never by some hooded priests carrying around luck rabbits&rsquo; feet!
</p>

<p>
The clergy itself doesn&rsquo;t have an official structure. Most of the time they
don&rsquo;t have a collective direction. When I was there I saw them determining
some course of action for the sect, I saw them enumerate the choices and
then cast dice. It is this author&rsquo;s humble opinion that the church of
Avandra endures only because of, well, luck!
</p>

<p>
Avandra might be an essential member of the gods but if I were to become a
man of the cloth I&rsquo;d keep looking and not leave my life up to chance.

It is theorized that elves are the creations of Sehanine - an
ever-changing shape-shifter god. Many races are said to have spawned from
the elves. The most apparent ones are the high elves of Bel&rsquo;aheldan and
the wood elves of Minheimia.
</p>

<p>
Less known of elvish relations are harpies, banshees, eldarin, and even
ghouls.
</p>

<p>
Rest assured that any form an elf takes will always be better than yours.
Hubris!

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--harpies">
<p>
Cruel and spiteful creatures, the first harpy is said to come from a
female elf who stumbled upon Sehanine himself in a forest. Sehanine paid
her no attention and had departed as quickly as he was noticed. But the
elf had fallen in love. She was unable to find him, and fell into a deep
sorrow. She cursed the gods for exposing her to such beauty. Her hatred
took form and gave her wings, and turned her heart to evil.
</p>

<p>
That an elf could get so resentful and disgruntled to turn their arms to
feathered wings and legs of a bird of prey is ridiculous. Elves fall in
love and have highly emotional heartbreaks all of the time, but we never
hear about them turning to harpies.
</p>
</div>

<li><a id="dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--banshees"></a>banshees<br />
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--banshees">
<p>
Scholars record that Banshees are elves who lived lives of excess of
some kind, and when they perished they continued to live on as dreadful
undead creatures. They beautiful yet marred apparitions whose love for
their excess continues in their restless afterlife. They dwell in their
homes of old, usually in ruins of elven establishments. Given time they
drive out all of the other occupants, or kill them, assuming they didn&rsquo;t
do either in their former lives already.
</p>

<p>
To stop a banshee is a boastful claim indeed. The banshee&rsquo;s wail brings
their suffering unto their victims, and the wail is often too much for
the living to bear.
</p>

<p>
On my travels we came across forgotten wood-elven cities, and one such
had a mirror. My companion picked it up, and looked upon it. I could see
in the reflection a gaunt, ghostly face behind him, with glowing eyes.
It was reaching towards him. I turned to face it, thinking the
reflection was showing me where the real creature was. But nothing was
there. When I turned back to my companion, Wilfred I think was his name,
the mirror was on the ground, and Wilfred was no where to be seen. I
looked for 10 minutes, which is twice the time I promise to any of my
guides.
</p>

<p>
In my nightmares I think of that face in the mirror. I still remember
Wilfred&rsquo;s face staring back at me too. The face in the mirror perfectly
matches the accounts I could find of the pale and ale-addled folks I
could find.
</p>

<p>
Many rumors exist of such a mirror exist. Some claim it can be a portal
to a realm that is a dark mockery of ours called the &ldquo;Shadowfell&rdquo; or
some such nonsense, and its location is always that of the banshee&rsquo;s
domain. A domain locked in permanent pain and suffering. That&rsquo;s right,
my friend: Even elves and their offshoots suffer better than you do.
Others have said a blade could be forged around a shard of such a
mirror, and its cut saps the life out of anything it touches. If one
wielded two such blades and rang them together, it would create a
splitting sound akin to the wail of a banshee, and to similar deadly
effect! Fortunately we do not live in such a world of madness, and no
scholar has documented such weapons.

The elves will tell you that eldarin are but a close cousin race like
the wood elves are to the high elves, and they change their appearance
and demeanor with the seasons. They are said to be much more strongly
tied with the fey and share the whimsicalness that comes with it. I&rsquo;ve
met an eldarin once and it didn&rsquo;t change with the seasons, but every
day! The elves come up with such stories, and they make things difficult
to get a true account!

<p>
In Bel&rsquo;aheldan, even the peasant class seem to be tied with some magic.
They have the floors swept with unmanned brooms, and clean clothes of
their masters with but a thought.
</p>

<p>
They call themselves the high elves - one presumes because they are so
arrogant - and seem to universally display an affinity to the use of
magical spells.
</p>

<p>
The nation of Bel&rsquo;aheldan itself carries with it a mission to use magic
for the betterment of all, and rid of us the need for manual labors and
petty chores. But they don&rsquo;t understand that summoned food and water can
never beat finely aged wine. Cleaning clothing is more than washing - it
is restoring the original lift to the clothes! What magic makes a collar
carry the flare of knowing a servant has poured their love of the craft
and even the love of their master into it? I still miss Wilfred&rsquo;s
attention to detail. But I digress.
</p>

<p>
When they aren&rsquo;t trying to foolishly rid themselves of the peasantry,
they collectively apply magic to create wondrous infrastructure. It is
said that even the small villages of Bel&rsquo;aheldan harbor portals to
Cendwar in the event of some catastrophic emergency.

<p>
Troops carry medallions that notify their generals of death of the troops
from afar. The troops themselves can also be signaled for withdrawal with
the medallions. The medallion changes from a gentle blue to a deep yellow
when the troop is being summoned. It is no surprise that the elven army
calls their troops &ldquo;Bel&rsquo;heldin&rdquo; - roughly &ldquo;sky-fighters&rdquo; in the common
tongue, and the generals are &ldquo;Val&rsquo;Genier&rdquo;, or &ldquo;seeing suns&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
If &ldquo;Bel&rsquo;heldin&rdquo; sounds familiar to you, it is because &ldquo;Bel&rsquo;aheldan&rdquo;
itself translates into common as &ldquo;People of the sky&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moon shone ones&rdquo;,
or &ldquo;Star children&rdquo; depending on the inflection.

The high elves tend to decorate themselves with feathers and moon stone.
To be high elf of Bel&rsquo;aheldan is to be elevated, wise, connected with
the weave which is the essence of the world, and most of all it&rsquo;s easy
to hold your nose up to the rest of us.

<p>
Bel&rsquo;aheldan have houses devoted to the various schools of magic, and
some houses whose specialty is either divine or of some non-scholastic
arcane source. Houses can be thought of as loose affiliations of
families who share interest in the same sorts of discoveries. The
reality is much more complex than that, but it&rsquo;s a good place to start.
Houses all must devote a share of their populace to guard or patrol
duty. The most common patrols are for Tentaku to keep the orcs from
making incursions. The patrols themselves can address small amounts of
orcs on their own, but anything larger and they call upon the
Bel&rsquo;heldin. Contributing to army functions are a way for a house lacking
in magical accomplishments to earn some prestige. In the past, the less
prestigious houses were underrepresented in Bel&rsquo;aheldanii affairs, and
so houses resorted to toxic extremes to earn recognition and therefore
power amongst their peers.
</p>

<p>
Today, Bel&rsquo;aheldan ensures that all houses can only go so far with their
prestige. Instead prestigious positions are managed by multiple houses,
and a house may only have so many dignitaries.

<p>
The Bel&rsquo;aheldanii do not covet magical knowledge for their sole use, and
freely share it. Some of the best dwarven architects are known to study
a great deal amongst these elves. This is so they can use enchanted
materials to do more with their structures.
</p>

<p>
In its darker times, there was less regulation on what kinds of magics
were studied, and houses contended more fiercely for honor and
recognition amongst their ranks. The combination of these things has led
to Bel&rsquo;aheldan&rsquo;s greatest disasters - such as fiendish incursions and a
nation-wide spell cast upon every citizen within its borders.
</p>

<p>
Exploration of the weave is kept in check today as well. Magical studies
require researchers from at least three houses are participating in the
study.

The elves and orcs have a long standing hatred. There are no embassies
amongst these lands. Bel&rsquo;aheldan has taken up the mantle of being the
first line of defense in orcish incursion. Along the southern borders
of Tentaku are Bel&rsquo;aheldanii patrols. The eastern border and lake of
Toadslick is held by Bel&rsquo;aheldanii. Nomasgard used to hold the land,
but when orcs broke through and circled into elven territory through a
relatively unguarded border, it was deemed that Bel&rsquo;aheldanii would
hold jurisdiction there. Nomasgard bolsters Tentaku&rsquo;s eastern front
with troops of their own. Many trackers and scouts receive their
training alongside the elves. It is a strong symbol of the alliance of
the two nations, and rumored to be the result of most half elves born
out of Duranae. Here the elves do all the teaching, because as we all
know, Elves are better than us at everything.

<p>
The nation of Minheimia has an estranged relationship with Bel&rsquo;aheldan.
Minheimia contributes to southeastern patrols, and fill gaps in the
Bel&rsquo;aheldanii defenses as needed. This is out of sense of kindred and
hatred of orcs in equal parts. Though there are writings indicating
that Bel&rsquo;aheldan and Minheimia were both a single nation, but the high
elves lorded over their more nature-bound cousins. The wood elves
claimed second class citizenry, and were considered subjugated. Some of
the oldest wood elves compare it to outright slavery. The ancient
members of the Bel&rsquo;aheldanii claim it was for their protection and
welfare. Both can agree that wood elves departed to the east and stood
in a line that marks the Bel&rsquo;aheldanii-Minheimian border today. Then
they did the most absurd thing; they stared at each other for 3 days
and 3 nights. At which point they parted, and Minheimia has been its
own sovereign nation since then.
</p>

<p>
The foundation of Minheimia is considered mythical as much of the other
elves&rsquo; ancient history. There is evidence of heavy conflict in
Bel&rsquo;aheldan&rsquo;s soil. Shallow graves, armor and weapons left with the
bodies, and ruins of towns that never got rebuilt litter Bel&rsquo;aheldan
everywhere, not in any relation to the Bel&rsquo;aheldanii-Tentakish border.
There are some records that indicate Bel&rsquo;aheldan entered a time called
&ldquo;The Blight of Devils&rdquo;, which suggests one side or another employed
infernal powers long ago - probably for the civil war itself.
</p>

<p>
If elves wouldn&rsquo;t lean so hard on their symbolism maybe we&rsquo;d know the
real truth.
</p>

<p>
Elves forget slowly, and for generations to stop passing on their
inherited hatreds takes much longer than the rest of us, but there are
signs of healing. Minheimia lends its scouts and naturalists to aid the
Bel&rsquo;aheldan borders with Tentaku.

<p>
The melting pot nation of Nomasgard share a close alliance with
Bel&rsquo;aheldan. Duranae&rsquo;s use of magic in the city&rsquo;s foundation itself
has attracted the high wizards of Bel&rsquo;aheldan since the nations have
recorded history of each other. Nomasgard&rsquo;s arcanists similarly
frequent to the capital of Cendwar to delve into more magical secrets.
</p>

<p>
Wizards from both cities can easily afford the teleportation fees.
</p>

<p>
Nomasgard and Bel&rsquo;aheldan share defensive duties amongst Tentaku&rsquo;s
southeastern borders. Both elven blade and bow-work are passed onto the
troops there, and combative casters can put their magical theories to
the test. Can you imagine how dangerous magical studies would be if
they were practiced indoors with nothing but the citizenry nearby? I
shudder to think of the property damage.

<p>
The chief export of Bel&rsquo;aheldan is magic - in a sense. Wizards can be
chartered to perform great magical acts, give advice on arcane matters,
create magical artifacts, and some suggest the capture and storage of
weapons too powerful for individuals or even nations to responsibly
bear.
</p>

<p>
In turn Bel&rsquo;aheldan seeks magics to supplement their own arts. The state
itself pays handsomely for moonstone. Officials whisper when there is
enough moonstone accumulated to have a statue of every high elf, all the
high elves will depart the realm and take on a new form that is one of
raw magic, and they shall live in the weave itself.

The elven nation of Minheimia takes its name from the elvish &ldquo;minhela&rdquo;,
meaning &ldquo;unshackled&rdquo;, &ldquo;unbridled&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;unsaddled&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;eimia&rdquo;
part of the name means &ldquo;stand of&rdquo; in common, but backwards because it&rsquo;s
elvish. Minheimia claims to have splintered from Bel&rsquo;aheldan in a civil
war that - I can&rsquo;t make this up - ended with all of the wood elves and
high elves staring at each other at what is now the border between the
two, and not a drop of blood.

<p>
Minheimia is a beautiful land with lush grasslands broken by dense
forests with proud trees. Spire Fur trees grow to enormous heights and
cast out wide branches. Much of the forests, including the capital of
Kep Aelar itself, are covered by a canopy that leaves everything dark,
like a deep overcast without the gloom. At least most of the time. Some
places in those forests instill some primal fear - like every branch is
an outreached arm, and every shadow conceals eyes that stare upon you
with dreadful malice.
</p>

<p>
Even the mountains to Minheimia&rsquo;s eastern side are covered in lush
plant life. The Ring River between Minheimia and Nomasgard is said to
look like moving glass.
</p>

<p>
In my travels, I never found a farm of any kind. No fields, no fenced
areas, and no obviously domesticated animals. The Minheimians truly live
in harmony with the land.

The primary armed forces in Minheimia are their scout-trackers, and
naturalists. The scout-trackers are said to do sniper duty - killing
enemy leaders and sending armies into disarray - all without being
caught. The naturalists command nature itself to lash out at their foes.
Imagine grass tickling an armored army! Ridiculous!

Every structure in Minheimia looks like a stone ruin. Half made
buildings with no roofs - sometimes they have more complicated
configurations, but all of them share a sense of exposure and a deep
lack of privacy. The wood elves are an open people and either sleep
under the stars or the trees. Some have dirt or leaf litter for
flooring. Generally if some elves want a private conversation, they
either go for a walk or write in the dirt to one another.
</p>

<p>
One structure of note is the arena of Kep Aelar, which suggests a savage
side to the wood elves, in keeping with their close bond to nature.

Records exist of a war when the simple southwestern folk of Nomasgard
began a lumbering project that went unchecked. Though still Nomasgard
territory, the scout-trackers of Minheimia learned of this and began
humiliating the lumberjacks of the area. Humiliation then turned to
injury. Eventually injury gave way to death. A war was started.
Nomasgardian forces were dispatched, and though blood was shed on both
sides, Nomasgard shed the most. In an act of frustration the forces
were split and went to set fire to the trees as a way of injuring the
elves. The original lumber project was forgotten, and only vengeance
was what the humans had appetite for. The wood elves record that,
without any prompting on their end, gnomes of the local area -
presumably living in or under these trees - baffled the humans with
illusions and caused the humans to set fire to their own crops! The
humans eventually learned to touch a tree before burning it. The elves
surrendered to spare a forest that wasn&rsquo;t even theirs. The Nomasgard
general was a practical one, and conscripted the elves to help them
push the borders of Tentaku back on the Nomasgard front. They
accomplished their goal, but all of the scout-trackers perished.
</p>

<p>
Today Minheimia and Nomasgard live in peace and have better outlines of
territory and respect for the land. A descendant of the general gave
the land won by the scout-trackers to Minheimia. Nomasgard forces hold
it to this day, but Minheimians are considered sovereigns to that odd
speck of territory. Some of the relatives of the scout-trackers travel
the grave sites there as pilgrimage.

<p>
Gazgren is far from the bulk of Minheimia, but the grave sites near
Tentaku are not. The hatred of orcs and elves is well known enough for
a silly goblin to tell you. The hobgoblins planned an ambush for the
main remembrance day at the grave site, and upon executing it were able
to capture all of the elves there. Just as their relatives were pushed
to conscription, so too were these elves compelled by the goblinoids to
fight for territory and spoils for the goblinoid armies. They initially
performed well, and earned much trust from the goblinoids from
consistent results. The hogoblin commanders promised freedom once the
next camp was taken, but the promise was remade again for yet another
camp, and so on. Not being a group of just scout-trackers, these
elves were able to fool the hobgoblins into approaching an orc
stronghold thinking its defenders dead and spoils ready for the taking.
The orcs thought themselves to be reinforced by a neighboring tribe
that was weaker and understood who was really in charge. Both parties
were caught by surprise when the veil was removed. Inside the camp the
fight was brutal. The few survivors were swiftly dispatched by the wood
elves, and they razed the camp. A war wagon piled with orc ears and
hobgoblin heads was found deserted in Gazgren&rsquo;s territory just outside
of Tentaku. The hogoblins received the message that the elves would not
be used in such a way again.

One topic any two kinds of elves can agree on is hatred of orcs.
Minheimia sends small parties of its ranging and naturalist troops to
help watch the southeastern borders of Tentaku. They also have members
that help watch Tentaku&rsquo;s easter fronts, and watch over their burial
shrines. That area is technically under Minheimia&rsquo;s jurisdiction, but
Nomasgard bolsters its forces and the Nomasgardians sent there benefit
from training of how to live off the land, scout unseen, and talk to
chipmunks.
</p>

<p>
The elves would never allow me to journey with them, but I was able to
present myself as a transfer to the Nomasgardian troop posted there. I
learned how to find berries! I am unsure why Nomasgard continues to
send troops specifically for training and patrol duties. How can you
fend off orcs with berries?

The relationship between dwarves and elves is a strange one. Dwarves

ancient, unwritten times. Glintstrad uses the Road of Bones as a major

The star Valan comes from the elven word for &ldquo;judge&rdquo;. Every 43 years the star
grows to take up a size that is about a quarter of the moon. The most peak time
of it lasts for about one month, which the elves call &ldquo;Sque valan&rdquo;; elven for
&ldquo;judgment rendered&rdquo; or &ldquo;reparations&rdquo;, depending on the inflection. It is bright
enough to leave a faint deep red glow at night.
</p>

<p>
It also has a unique property in that it has a baffling effect on creatures with
darkvision. Their darkvision simply doesn&rsquo;t work in those 30 or so days. The
elves say that this is Valan coming to judge those arrogant enough to walk in
the night. Those who have darkvision describe their sight in the dark as being a
red that seems impossibly dim but strains the eyes as if it were intensely
bright.
</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s also interesting is that this effect applies even to things that are
shielded from the light of Valan, and even during the day when Valan is no where
to be seen. Creatures that dwell underground cannot see at all and must rely
upon other senses. Underground creatures fall into two rough categories: One is
hibernation. For others, they go to the surface. This makes for a very chaotic
time indeed! Most civilized regions have provisions and guards to handle this.
Other, more remote areas will either go into their basements or temporarily
seeks shelter in places that do have defenses. In Gyoro, it is a capital offense
to refuse shelter to any of the goodly races during this 30 day period.

only at night, and our sun only present at day.

There are historic paintings that show Valan side by side with the sun

Nomasgard sends troops of its armies to known caves and builds fires to
lure out creatures that are otherwise blind to everything else. This
becomes a killing field, and many trophies are gathered during this time.
It&rsquo;s considered a sort of reward for many soldiers, and a way to blend
different units together to trade stories, techniques, drinks, and to even
&ldquo;work off steam&rdquo;. Though no steam is produced. I am sorry to say, my
friend, I was not able to find any dealings with steam in my readings or
talking to elders of this affair. I shall endeavor to be of strong mind
and health for my next Sque Valan so I can report back more!

<p>
The orcs of Tentaku believe Valan to be the eye of Gruumsh coming closer
to see that the orcs are worthy. This incites them to aggressive action.
Armies are said to repel their attacks, but many, sneakier orcs manage to
slip by and wreak havoc in the bergs behind the army lines. Even with a
chaotic countryside, the orcs numbers dwindle rapidly from losses of
fighting. After Valan recedes, those near Tentaku celebrate.
</p>

<p>
Gazgren&rsquo;s goblinoids do the opposite of the orcs, and will set aside their
internal differences. Leaders of the legions dine with one another and
speak of greater conquests for Maglubiyet. The years that follow are
sorrowful for Gazgren&rsquo;s neighbors.
</p>

<p>
The elves of Bel&rsquo;aheldan use this time to get in more meditation time and
self reflect upon the last 43 years. They make new resolutions to better
themselves, or begin a new task. Some will use this time to more deeply
explore their romance lives. Many of their tales of love center around
this time. But elven romance novels are so boring! They just stare at each
other for pages and pages!

The rugged people of Vyxt use Sque Valan to hunt great beasts that trouble
their lands, or could trouble their parched lands, for that matter.

<p>
It is commonly known that the nation of Vyxt is a majority of dragonborn
citizens. Legend has it that this was at one point the home of dragons.
Vyxt is syntactically very close to the draconic word &ldquo;vyskarix&rdquo;, which
closely translates to &ldquo;home&rdquo; in the common tongue. The dragons would
fight amongst each other and their losses became great. The dragons
agreed to leave each other alone and allow lesser creatures to handle
their squabbles while the dragons bathed in piles of riches in peace.
</p>

<p>
If you believe that pile of rubble, let me go on: It is said that Tiamat,
the evil queen of dragons, birthed the first kobolds by hatching her eggs
prematurely. Tiamat&rsquo;s estranged lover, Bahamut, had sequestered some of
the same eggs for himself, and incubated the dragonborn from them. Both
races spread across the land of Vyxt, and brought riches to their dragon
lords as homage. Happy dragons meant intact villages.
</p>

<p>
At some point, a powerful red dragon backed by a conniving green dragon
and a devious blue dragon positioned themselves as the most powerful
dragons of Vyxt. From there they claimed rulership over the dragonborn,
and the world itself entered a dark age.
</p>

<p>
The dragonborn clans, for both better and worse, boast their lineage back
to such times. Many clans allied themselves to the chromatic dragons and
benefited greatly. Some worked in secret to help eventually overthrow the
chromatic dragons. Today the dragonborn clans don&rsquo;t see things as allies
of good and evil as you and I might see it. Instead the clans aligned
with chromatics are seen as loyal, yet simple. The clans aligned against
the chromatics are seen as intelligent, but scheming. There are of course
exceptions and these sweeping generalizations primarily exhibit
themselves when dragonborn gossip much like those in Egalstan do about
the phase of the red star they were born under. It also comes out in
ceremonies between the nobles of the dragonborn courts. The traits of a
clan are used as a kind of honorific, and those traits are said to hail
back to an age when the dragons ruled, and the dragonborn were but
servants to the dragons.

The dragonborn courts are a sight to behold. Everything that is dragonborn
is impressively big. Their ceilings rise high, and tapestries must be
equally long. The artisanship lacks the flare you see in the sturdy
dwarven stonework or fine elven ornaments.

The royalty of Vyxt allowed me to sit in on their court proceedings and a
aspiring ambassador explained all of the nuances to me. It was a very
straightforward affair. Usually I have to sneak in and remain hidden for
these sorts of things! Although I will say, dragonborn court servants make
lousy grape peelers. They just gave them to me mashed!

<p>
When using charms and other lures to get a loose tongue, the Vyxtians
warm up fastest with proper use of their clan titles than exotic trinkets
or the sounds of coins rubbing together.
</p>

<p>
When speaking to each other their clan heritage comes out in formal,
structured ways that give respects to the formally acknowledge strengths
of the clan. Dragonborn use a subtle pre-title as a means of indicating
peacefulness or goodwill, and it is always respectful. For example, The
Scherix clan is known to be fair. The honorific form of Scherix is &ldquo;Fair
Scherix&rdquo; in the common tongue. Dragonborn even love it when their clan
honorific is used in another tongue such as common. It gives them a
little flavor over their one-word complement they receive by showing its
various subtleties and color from other languages. To show even a common
dragonborn their honorific when addressing them never goes unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
To use the dragonborn clan&rsquo;s negative honorific is to be abrasive,
insulting, or even aggressive in an imminent way. Like the positive
honorific, it never goes unnoticed, and is never spoken in jest, no matter
how familiar you might be with the dragonborn or their clan. This leads to
many conflicts with other races where respect and bonding is communicated
in ways that are very complex to the dragonborn. Using our example of
Scherix, they are known to be greedy. The negative honorific is &ldquo;Greedy
Scherix&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
If you try to make up a negative honorific (like &ldquo;Wasteful Scherix&rdquo;), it&rsquo;s
confusing and comes off as non-sequitur. While the dragonborn might
understand that you&rsquo;re trying to insult them, the feeling of just how off
your statement is will overpower that, generally.
</p>

<p>
Leaving off an honorific has an interesting interaction. Dragonborn are
very direct in their social dealings. Leaving off the honorific in their
clan name means you know their clan, but you don&rsquo;t wish to honor or
dishonor it. You don&rsquo;t really wish anything with it at all. It
communicates an indifference that other races might be insulted by. For
dragonborn it simply means you have no immediate desire to strengthen a
relationship with them (friend or foe). It&rsquo;s generally used when
communicating with strangers or talking about trade matters.

Dragonborn chief exports are glass of all kinds from their deserts, and
miscellaneous treasures. The glass some dragonborn can create with their
powerful breath. I am told that many go digging in the sands to find the
wealth of dragons left behind from their wars, but I know better! They
have quite a racket going on, creating baubles behind their shops and
talking about how they come from some forgotten age! Bah! But the stories
sound good. I managed to procure some and plan on taking the stories with
me to Duranae to fetch a handy sum. I might be on to them, but I can&rsquo;t

<p>
Dragonborn are hulking, brutish creatures and have monstrous appetites
compared to the other goodly races. Vyxt&rsquo;s primary import is food, and
for their own food it tends to be primarily meat. Meat is the filler
ingredient in their dishes, with other nutrients being wrapped or stuffed
in the meat almost apologetically. Vyxt&rsquo;s deserts don&rsquo;t leave much
fertile land for tilled fields and wheat. Instead Vyxtian farms are
mostly for raising indigenous desert livestock, such as any large
serpents, also small serpents, cows, goats, pigs, and rarely giant
insects. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for Vyxtian ranchers to be skilled warriors
out of necessity of their trade.
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend pork-wrapped viper sauteed in (giant) scorpion venom.
As a national delicacy goes, it does not disappoint! It should be noted
that elves might want to try a different dish, due to the hallucinogenic
properties of the venom on elven physiology. This is no recreational
hallucinogen but instead tends to provoke violent actions from the
consumer.

Clans pay the state in tithe of recruits for soldiers. Soldiers hold a
lot of honor amongst the dragonborn, and even a retired veteran is
held in a baseline reverence.
</p>

<p>
All aspects of the Vyxt armies involve some kind of magical assault.
Scouts learn both simple spells to move faster or help themselves remain
hidden. The rank and file troops learn simple attack spells or even
spells that augment their brute strength. Shock troops pick up defensive
spells that make their forms hard to make out, or minor teleportation
spells to get in and out quickly. Drake riders learn spells that anchor
their flying prey so the ground units can finish them off. Even the lowly
gate wall guards learn spells of compulsion and detection to spot thieves
and contraband; Though they did use this to determine I had fine nymphish
pipeweed on hand and confiscated it! I had intended to use that pipeweed
to give to the general. It would&rsquo;ve relaxed her to the point of letting
me see how their mysterious black claws operate.

<p>
The citizens of Vyxt are hardy, strong, and proud. They lack many of the
creature comforts you and I know of. For them, life is a trial to prove
oneself. They are less likely to use contraptions and devices to make
life easier. However Vyxt invests much in sorcerous studies. Unlike the
utility and art of Bel&rsquo;aheldanii magical works, Vyxtian magic is
primarily studied for combat and those spells that promise high value in
war are prioritized. Even in times of peace, the Vyxt believe that the
next war is around the bend. Any dragonborn will tell you that casting
off the dragon rule was a cost they don&rsquo;t wish to pay a second time.
</p>

<p>
One should be careful about asking about such things. My assistant
Valaria was fingered to the authorities and immediately detained by some
of Bahamut&rsquo;s order. When dealing with strict authorities such as those in
Vyxt, it is important to use proxies to gather information as I have.
Imagine if I had my papers confiscated! Sometimes I wonder what happened
to Valaria. She was always a clever conversationalist, and loyal to the
end I am absolutely sure. Still, better to leave the area just in case.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--religions">
<p>
The primary deities worshiped in Vyxt are Bahamut and Tiamat - the dragon
gods of the pantheon. The dragonborn relationship with dragons is a
complicated one. They hate the dragons for enslavement, but derive
incredible pride in themselves and, as part of themselves, their draconic
heritage. Dragons represent power to them; Sometimes terrible, and
sometimes wonderful.
</p>

<p>
While Tiamat is known to be a god of evil, the dragonborn see a
practicality in that evil when it comes to war. In their view, killing is
never a good thing, but it is sometimes (or oftentimes, depending on
which dragonborn you&rsquo;re talking to) necessary. Instead of worshiping her
for evil purposes, they instead venerate her aspect of vengeance and
wealth - to match the needs of war and the benefit of spoils from that
war. In the mind of a Vyxtian, leaving the spoils is just wasteful, and
even disrespectful to the dead. Paladins of Tiamat are employed as
warrior-generals of their armies, and an order of them comprises one kind
of their elite strike forces.
</p>

<p>
Bahamut is revered by almost all nobles. His followers comprise most of
the churches of healing, and their holy knights help police internal
affairs of Vyxt. If there is a traitor in their midst, the holy knights
of Bahamut work tirelessly to root them out. Bahamut&rsquo;s holy knights can
detect magical auras and even sense lies. It is important to gather the
unfettered truth when compiling these works of mine. To evade these
powers it is good to be in a place where a magical aura already exists,
or be ready to create your own with blessed holy water or druidic
berries - items which seem innocent enough but baffle such detection. I
have heard other writers carry a talking doll or illusory pocket
paintings to ensure the schools of magic shown are expected. Rest assured
that my techniques are much more advanced than these ideas that were
surely thought up on a short wagon ride.
</p>

<p>
Worshipers from both sides accept Bahamut and Tiamat&rsquo;s relationship as a
complex one, much as the dragonborn themselves have a complex
relationship with dragons. Worshipers of one dragon deity will show
respect and sometimes even act in partnership with the deity of the
other.

The most immediate neighbors of Vyxt are the dwarves of Glintstrad and
the humans of Cyorro. Their histories together are mottled with wars over
resources. There is a friendly relationship with Nomasgard, and a niche
one with Bel&rsquo;aheldan. Other nations are too far or too unconcerned with
Vyxt to be of great interest to the nation as a whole.

<p>
One such war was fought mostly underground - the dwarves had dug their
tunnels far into Vyxtian territory and they happened upon preserved
dragon hordes from ancient times. The dwarves had pilfered much by the
time the horde-guards had spotted them. The Vyxt do not act kindly when
one uses a pick to pry the gemstones out of their history. While the
dwarves were in their primary terrain, the dragonborn were fighting with
a cause they felt righteous. The dwarves were beaten back and they left
empty handed. Today there is a treaty in place declaring clearly that
the borders between the two extend underground as well. Maps have been
drawn showing such caverns. Though one expects such boundaries are hard
to enforce, and a dwarf would be a fool to call out for Vyxtian guards
upon arriving in a large dragon horde and the owner nowhere to be seen.

<p>
Long ago, Cyorro was duped by a clever dragon into laying siege to an
area of worthless sand in Vyxt territory. The dragonborn didn&rsquo;t put up
much of a fight for that area, and lost much territory in this process.
Today Cyorro has offered some of that land back in reparation, but the
spoils are gone forever - probably hidden near the basements and attics
of many a warrior&rsquo;s inheritors. Legend has it that the dragon sought a
dark green orb with power to bring back the dead or capture souls for
strange and mostly unknown soul magic. I just wish I could blame a
crafty green dragon for anything the dragonborn authorities didn&rsquo;t like!

<p>
Across the Valiant Sea, Nomasgard is the closest sea-based state to
Vyxt, and much trading is done there instead of traversing Glintstrad -
depending on where the good are coming from. Nomasgard, Glintstrad, and
Vyxt all donate a pool of patrol fleets, which are even cross-staffed
between the nations of Nomasgard and Glintstrad. Still, Vyxt keeps a
navy of its own. Self sufficiency is vital to the dragonborn, and they
view slavery in many forms - alliances and politics potentially being
another kind.

<p>
Dragonborn pirates operate large vessels instead of smaller and faster
ones. They are escorted by a convoy and while they can&rsquo;t always catch
trade ships, they can corral their victims or even take on lightly
guarded trade ships. The navies usually can only track such ships from
their smaller reconnaissance vessels. Any good dragonborn captain will
have a sorcerer onboard to hide its location or even completely relocate
the ship. This keeps the pirates at large and still having much larger
ships for large hauls and a sort of base of operations from which other
pirates strike out.
</p>

<p>
It is said an order of dragonborn is maintained who seek wizardry from
the elves of Bel&rsquo;aheldan. Not all dragonborn can easily harness their
dragonic heritage for sorcerous powers. However, the costs of such a
journey for an individual are many, especially for a lone trip. Typically
only the nobility can afford the trips, let alone the steep costs of such
tutelage. These warrior-wizards are said to be represented in every
clan - a way of stating that the dragonborn embrace their draconic
heritage by choice rather than necessity.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--economy--magic-items--magic-item-list--platonic-dispenser">
<p>
This item appears to be a large potion bottle. Atop its mouth is an angular
contraption that points in one direction. It has a lever. The bottle is full of
a clear fluid of yellowish tint.
</p>

<p>
When the trigger is depressed, this object produces a stream of fluid. On
contact with a creature, that creature becomes wet and loses any romantic
feelings for the user, magically induced or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
The bottle can be used 20 times before it empties. If it empties, it must be
magically refilled by an item enchanter. If it is refilled with water before it
empties, it can keep going for another 20 uses. It never dilutes.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--economy--magic-items--magic-item-list--rope-of-tangling">
<p>
This 50 feet of rope tangles itself. Any rope work attempted with it is done
with disadvantage. This rope can be tied to any other rope to cause that rope to
be tangled, but for any other purpose is done at disadvantage.
</p>

<p>
If tied to any rope based mechanism successfully, that machine fails and cannot
move.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--economy--magic-items--magic-item-list--ruby-hilted-dagger">
<p>
This ruby hilted dagger is a +1 dagger. Once per day, the dagger can be pointed
at a target within throwing range, and the ruby pressed. This makes a ranged
weapon attack at advantage using all of the properties of the dagger as if it
were thrown. The dagger itself is not thrown as part of this, but shoots out a
magical, ruby-like copy of the dagger. This fired dagger always inflicts maximum
damage.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--economy--magic-items--magic-item-list--stickers-of-weapon-dazzling">
<p>
This is a sheet of 20 star stickers. The stars twinkle slightly against the
light.  When placed on the surface of the weapon (all stickers must be placed),
the weapon becomes magical and sheds dim light in a 20 foot radius.
</p>

<p>
Each time the weapon deals damage, a single sticker falls off and loses its
sticky properties.
</p>

<p>
Replacement sticker sheets can be purchased at a discount if the old stickers
and sheet returned.
