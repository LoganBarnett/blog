<p>
This is a series of essays written in the voice of <a href="#dirshum--historic-characters--golani-grumsvelt">Golani Grumsvelt</a>, a
pompous and arrogantly privileged playboy. He tends to dismiss mythical
things, in spite of how true they might actually be.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--account-of-duranae">
<p>
Nicknamed "Jewel of Dirshum", Duranae has established itself as a grand
intersection of being both a melting pot of cultures and a city that
prospers from all of the things our magical realm has to offer. It has a
population of roughly three million souls (determined through magical
scrying). Sitting in the middle of the world and a coastal city, it has an
advantaged position for trade. All walks of life can be found here, but it
is predominantly human in the populace. While the races do mix there, they
also tend to gather in their own burrows and neighborhoods. It's rumored
some of the dwarves of Dirshum never see the light of day, content to work
their trades in the areas below.
</p>

<p>
Duranae has a little bit of something for everyone, except for privacy of
course. It's a city you can easily disappear in, but you're never by
yourself no matter how alone you might feel.
</p>

<p>
Areas in Duranae can be rough 5 major sections. The outer city comprises the
farmlands. These are protected by the city watch, but aside from occasional
patrols this is more of a first-responder force. The farms provide some
sustenance for the city, but it is not nearly enough to sustain a population
of this magnitude. The primary crops consist of potatoes, wheat, and other
cheap-to-grow foods that are appropriate for the teeming masses.
</p>

<p>
As you move further into the city, before its walls, you will come across
its slums. These are hodge podge sheds and rickety dwellings that lean up
against the walls of Duranae. This is where the poorest of the poor live.
The city guards rarely patrol here, and those that do have a very cynical
outlook on life and their guard duties as well. EDIT: And let me tell you,
threatening me to divulge my sources is a criminal act! Or at least it
should be. I am your humble explorer - a cartographer of societies! Not a
study of the laws of just one city. But worry not Sheriff Vrot: Your guards
will still let me in the city if I make their pouches bulbous enough with
coin.
</p>

<p>
The third section, past the walls, is a place most people have been to and
think of when they mention Duranae. This is the middle quarter. It extends
from the walls marking the slums and farmlands all the way to the coast.
This is where the docks conduct their day to day affairs. Nomasgard has a
section of the docks devoted to its navy. Other parts of the docks are
closely connected to the bean counters of the trading guilds, and all goods
are carefully monitored and recorded. After seeing that, I wish I'd
considered starting a lucrative venture in parchment making! There are also
less savory parts of the docks. The privateer wharfs is a very no
questions-asked kind of place. My brave assistants stood firmly to see and
record everything though. Only a total of three fingers were lost during
entire endeavor. I count that a success. Ah - one more notable thing: the
middle quarter of Duranae is a large, think ring. The middle is empty! But
that brings us to our next section.
</p>

<p>
The fourth section is the lower quarter. Some of it sees sunlight, but much
of it is underground. In the middle quarter, the cityscape will rapidly
transition downhill and end in a great lift. Here the goods from below come
up, and the supplies needed for the city's lower area go down. Many dwarves
live in the lower quarter, but it's not exclusive to them. Much of the
digging is done by kobolds that I am assured to be quite friendly, but sadly
I could not spare assistants that day to test this claim. The kobolds have
dug out much of the aqueducts, channels of lava flow for the forges, and
even much of the mining. The dwarves there claim it is shoddy work, but even
they admit the city rests easily upon all of it. I couldn't find a single
gnome there!
</p>

<p>
Going further up from the middle quarter is the fifth and final section: The
upper quarter. The upper quarter is a ring that is wider than Duranae's
middle quarter. This is the floating part of the city, suspended high above
the highest buildings in the middle quarter. The lift from the lower quarter
reaches all the way to the upper quarter. The center where the lift reaches
the height of the upper quarter is a series crystalline bridges that run to
the ring where the upper quarter proper is. All goods go through the
strictest of checks, and the guards here are well paid by the trade guilds
to ensure no bribery can ever work. Here is where you can find the finest
food, wines, clothing, and even the most beautiful of the goodly races, no
matter what your preferences are. There are many elves and gnomes here. Any
artisan with a valuable trade can make a go here. Every single dwelling here
has a view that stretches inwards to the below quarters or out into the
beautiful countryside or coast of Nomasgard, depending on where you rest
upon the ring.
</p>

<p>
My later chapters will cover arcane influences on Duranae, the religious
establishments, and law and crime. Duranae is such a rich and wonderful city
that also has many secrets and splendors - all you have to do is look!

<h4 id="dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--avandra's-smile">Avandra's Smile</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--avandra's-smile">
<p>
Taken from Golani Grumsvelt's "Avandra's Smile", which was delayed in its
printing due to a strange goblin raid on the trade lines carrying inks:
</p>

<p>
Avandra has smiled upon all of us at one point or another in our lives.
Every time we attribute some favorable event as luck, we pay her a small
amount of reverence, and this sustains the goddess. Or so the priests of her
clergy tell me.
</p>

<p>
As part of our cataloging of the entire world of Duranae, we sometimes have
to do brave or absurd things. This time, bravery was not in high demand. We
entered as recent converts to a location I will not disclose today, and we
were able to learn much of the inner workings of the goddess and her
followers with an inside perspective.
</p>

<p>
The priests themselves are aloof and superstitious, and will attribute every
bloody sunny day in a summer to their goddess. They also carry around
sentimental trinkets that are unique to the individual, and they seem to
constantly fidget with it. You'd think it were a holy symbol with how the
priests grasp them! The priests feel that avoiding bad luck is just another
form of good luck. As a result they do all kinds of things to avoid bad luck
that we heard as children: They only walk on the right side of a fountain,
they avoid crossing the path of a black cat, and sprinkle their doorways
with spices during the 13th day of the month. Between myself and my
assistants infiltrating their order, we mixed up which superstitions we
chose in advance, but nobody seemed to notice. They are just happy to see
other people saying everything is good or bad luck!
</p>

<p>
Temples of Avandra are established places in part because it is not easy to
have sacred grounds on the move. There have been attempts at wheeled temples
in the past, but they never proved out. Instead they settle on doing
frequent redecoration. Avandra is also an aspect of change. The temples are
very open places and the winds can be felt shifting about no matter where
you stand. At the center of this is a fountain and it's typically littered
with copper coins. The clergy cleans it out daily and uses the coins as
donations. What Avandra gives to those who toss coins in her fountains we
did not find out.
</p>

<p>
Many deities reinvest in the societies that invest in their own churches.
Avandra's is no different. She deeply invests in the arts, fashion, music.
Avandra's followers also run many orphanages. The orphanages are stinking
cesspits crowded with simple brats! I lost my best shoes to one of those
thieving curs! But it makes one realize just how relative luck can be for
these orphanages to be considered good fortune for someone.
</p>

<p>
Unless you've suffered some kind of recent memory loss by an evil wizard,
you'll have heard "Avandra smile upon you!" or some similar statement. In
the common tongue this can show someone's eloquent upbringing and for the
masses it can sometimes be used facetiously.
</p>

<p>
Avandra's teachings guide us to live in the moment, take risks (fortune does
not come often at random but needs opportunity), and to ourselves be good
luck to others by readily offering help to any in need. As a result, she has
the most of her divinely blessed follows afield, manifesting good works in
her name. You'd think she encourages all of them to buffoons about their
inert little trinkets as well, for as good as the clergy follow that
pattern.
</p>

<p>
Paladins of her order tend to favor longer weapons and lighter armor.
Bringing good luck in the form of help to others is the essence of these
martial priests. I saw one whose mount was a beautiful fey horse, which you
can learn about in my other book: Fey-folk of Duranae. Her less martial
followers dress very plainly for the road, but you can always pick them
apart by their wavy lined holy symbols and belts adorned with various good
luck charms.
</p>

<p>
Avandra opposes devils above all. The contract locks things in and is used
to restrict fortune in the future. It robs those in the contract of their
future consent and therefore their freedom to have a blessed life. Devils
encompass everything she hates about contracts and how the fine print always
seems to capture mortals. She spends a lot of effort trying to thwart their
plans, but as gods do not directly exert their will in our realm, it's very
easy for the devils to operate without much interference. Some things they
catch, but much slips past her watch. For that matter she finds non-devilish
contracts distasteful for the same reasons. I for one feel this is naive
even for a god. My contracts I've established ensure I have a good and long
service from my assistants if they want to get paid. The turnover is very
high in my field!
</p>

<p>
Throughout history Avandra's power has waxed and waned. When she had a
disproportionate number of followers in the past, art flourished, gambling
institutions suffered, and rulers had a hard time keeping their thrones
under their rumps. When her followers dwindled, fashion stagnated, family
lines tended to keep their rule for generations, and people generally had a
sour outlook on their lives.
</p>

<p>
The last chosen of Avandra was a halfling named Rendil Fulburrow. It was
only revealed afterwards that he was a chosen, and he had no idea. Rendil,
simply put, is a fool that should have died long before history wrote his
name down. Every poor expense turned into some wonderful investment. Dangers
were diverted around him without his knowing, and he merrily strode along as
he did his "long walk" across the continent. He even wrote about his
travels, but even Avandra can't overcome the raw sales of my works! Quality
means something, my dear.
</p>

<p>
Avandra's relationships with the other gods is rather fleeting. In one
moment she will embrace Corellon as a the godly equivalent of a mate, and
other times they are all but enemies. It sounds like my third ex wife! Feel
free to pick up a copy of "The Wives of Dirshum" to broaden your views on
marriage.
</p>

<p>
Sehanine is an ally of Avandra and the priests attributed this to the
constant ebb and flow of the moon. This is utterly stupid. Changing
constantly is still a constant! The moon moves predictably. "Charting
Dishum's Night" covers this in great detail.
</p>

Avandra opposes Asmodeus most of all, with Bane a close second. Tyranny in
all of its forms is what she hates, and what those two bring about. It is
rumored that Avandra has specially appointed members of her church that hunt
down devil cults and slay them all before they grow too strong. Believe me
that these are myths, my friend. I have scoured our historical texts for
mass cultist slayings and on the rare occasion that it does happen, it's
never by some hooded priests carrying around luck rabbits' feet!
</p>

<p>
The clergy itself doesn't have an official structure. Most of the time they
don't have a collective direction. When I was there I saw them determining
some course of action for the sect, I saw them enumerate the choices and
then cast dice. It is this author's humble opinion that the church of
Avandra endures only because of, well, luck!
</p>

<p>
Avandra might be an essential member of the gods but if I were to become a
man of the cloth I'd keep looking and not leave my life up to chance.

It is theorized that elves are the creations of Sehanine - an
ever-changing shape-shifter god. Many races are said to have spawned from
the elves. The most apparent ones are the high elves of Bel'aheldan and
the wood elves of Minheimia.
</p>

<p>
Less known of elvish relations are harpies, banshees, eldarin, and even
ghouls.

Rest assured that any form an elf takes will always be better than yours.

Cruel and spiteful creatures, the first harpy is said to come from a
female elf who stumbled upon Sehanine himself in a forest. Sehanine paid
her no attention and had departed as quickly as he was noticed. But the
elf had fallen in love. She was unable to find him, and fell into a deep
sorrow. She cursed the gods for exposing her to such beauty. Her hatred
took form and gave her wings, and turned her heart to evil.
</p>

<p>
That an elf could get so resentful and disgruntled to turn their arms to
feathered wings and legs of a bird of prey is ridiculous. Elves fall in
love and have highly emotional heartbreaks all of the time, but we never
hear about them turning to harpies.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--elves--variety-of-blood--banshees">
<p>
Scholars record that Banshees are elves who lived lives of excess of
some kind, and when they perished they continued to live on as dreadful
undead creatures. They beautiful yet marred apparitions whose love for
their excess continues in their restless afterlife. They dwell in their
homes of old, usually in ruins of elven establishments. Given time they
drive out all of the other occupants, or kill them, assuming they didn't
do either in their former lives already.
</p>

<p>
To stop a banshee is a boastful claim indeed. The banshee's wail brings
their suffering unto their victims, and the wail is often too much for
the living to bear.
</p>

<p>
On my travels we came across forgotten wood-elven cities, and one such
had a mirror. My companion picked it up, and looked upon it. I could see
in the reflection a gaunt, ghostly face behind him, with glowing eyes.
It was reaching towards him. I turned to face it, thinking the
reflection was showing me where the real creature was. But nothing was
there. When I turned back to my companion, Wilfred I think was his name,
the mirror was on the ground, and Wilfred was no where to be seen. I
looked for 10 minutes, which is twice the time I promise to any of my
guides.
</p>

<p>
In my nightmares I think of that face in the mirror. I still remember
Wilfred's face staring back at me too. The face in the mirror perfectly
matches the accounts I could find of the pale and ale-addled folks I
could find.
</p>

<p>
Many rumors exist of such a mirror exist. Some claim it can be a portal
to a realm that is a dark mockery of ours called the "Shadowfell" or
some such nonsense, and its location is always that of the banshee's
domain. A domain locked in permanent pain and suffering. That's right,
my friend: Even elves and their offshoots suffer better than you do.
Others have said a blade could be forged around a shard of such a
mirror, and its cut saps the life out of anything it touches. If one
wielded two such blades and rang them together, it would create a
splitting sound akin to the wail of a banshee, and to similar deadly
effect! Fortunately we do not live in such a world of madness, and no
scholar has documented such weapons.

The elves will tell you that eldarin are but a close cousin race like
the wood elves are to the high elves, and they change their appearance

<p>
In Bel'aheldan, even the peasant class seem to be tied with some magic.
They have the floors swept with unmanned brooms, and clean clothes of
their masters with but a thought.
</p>

<p>
They call themselves the high elves - one presumes because they are so
arrogant - and seem to universally display an affinity to the use of
magical spells.
</p>

<p>
The nation of Bel'aheldan itself carries with it a mission to use magic
for the betterment of all, and rid of us the need for manual labors and
petty chores. But they don't understand that summoned food and water can
never beat finely aged wine. Cleaning clothing is more than washing - it
is restoring the original lift to the clothes! What magic makes a collar
carry the flare of knowing a servant has poured their love of the craft
and even the love of their master into it? I still miss Wilfred's
attention to detail. But I digress.
</p>

<p>
When they aren't trying to foolishly rid themselves of the peasantry,
they collectively apply magic to create wondrous infrastructure. It is
said that even the small villages of Bel'aheldan harbor portals to
Cendwar in the event of some catastrophic emergency.

Troops carry medallions that notify their generals of death of the troops
from afar. The troops themselves can also be signaled for withdrawal with
the medallions. The medallion changes from a gentle blue to a deep yellow
when the troop is being summoned. It is no surprise that the elven army
calls their troops "Bel'heldin" - roughly "sky-fighters" in the common
tongue, and the generals are "Val'Genier", or "seeing suns".
</p>

<p>
If "Bel'heldin" sounds familiar to you, it is because "Bel'aheldan"

<p>
Bel'aheldan have houses devoted to the various schools of magic, and
some houses whose specialty is either divine or of some non-scholastic
arcane source. Houses can be thought of as loose affiliations of
families who share interest in the same sorts of discoveries. The
reality is much more complex than that, but it's a good place to start.
Houses all must devote a share of their populace to guard or patrol
duty. The most common patrols are for Tentaku to keep the orcs from
making incursions. The patrols themselves can address small amounts of
orcs on their own, but anything larger and they call upon the
Bel'heldin. Contributing to army functions are a way for a house lacking
in magical accomplishments to earn some prestige. In the past, the less
prestigious houses were underrepresented in Bel'aheldanii affairs, and
so houses resorted to toxic extremes to earn recognition and therefore
power amongst their peers.
</p>

<p>
Today, Bel'aheldan ensures that all houses can only go so far with their
prestige. Instead prestigious positions are managed by multiple houses,
and a house may only have so many dignitaries.

<p>
The Bel'aheldanii do not covet magical knowledge for their sole use, and
freely share it. Some of the best dwarven architects are known to study
a great deal amongst these elves. This is so they can use enchanted
materials to do more with their structures.
</p>

<p>
In its darker times, there was less regulation on what kinds of magics
were studied, and houses contended more fiercely for honor and
recognition amongst their ranks. The combination of these things has led
to Bel'aheldan's greatest disasters - such as fiendish incursions and a
nation-wide spell cast upon every citizen within its borders.
</p>

<p>
Exploration of the weave is kept in check today as well. Magical studies
require researchers from at least three houses are participating in the
study.

The elves and orcs have a long standing hatred. There are no embassies
amongst these lands. Bel'aheldan has taken up the mantle of being the
first line of defense in orcish incursion. Along the southern borders
of Tentaku are Bel'aheldanii patrols. The eastern border and lake of
Toadslick is held by Bel'aheldanii. Nomasgard used to hold the land,
but when orcs broke through and circled into elven territory through a
relatively unguarded border, it was deemed that Bel'aheldanii would
hold jurisdiction there. Nomasgard bolsters Tentaku's eastern front
with troops of their own. Many trackers and scouts receive their
training alongside the elves. It is a strong symbol of the alliance of
the two nations, and rumored to be the result of most half elves born
out of Duranae. Here the elves do all the teaching, because as we all

<p>
The nation of Minheimia has an estranged relationship with Bel'aheldan.
Minheimia contributes to southeastern patrols, and fill gaps in the
Bel'aheldanii defenses as needed. This is out of sense of kindred and
hatred of orcs in equal parts. Though there are writings indicating
that Bel'aheldan and Minheimia were both a single nation, but the high
elves lorded over their more nature-bound cousins. The wood elves
claimed second class citizenry, and were considered subjugated. Some of
the oldest wood elves compare it to outright slavery. The ancient
members of the Bel'aheldanii claim it was for their protection and
welfare. Both can agree that wood elves departed to the east and stood
in a line that marks the Bel'aheldanii-Minheimian border today. Then
they did the most absurd thing; they stared at each other for 3 days
and 3 nights. At which point they parted, and Minheimia has been its
own sovereign nation since then.
</p>

<p>
The foundation of Minheimia is considered mythical as much of the other
elves' ancient history. There is evidence of heavy conflict in
Bel'aheldan's soil. Shallow graves, armor and weapons left with the
bodies, and ruins of towns that never got rebuilt litter Bel'aheldan
everywhere, not in any relation to the Bel'aheldanii-Tentakish border.
There are some records that indicate Bel'aheldan entered a time called
"The Blight of Devils", which suggests one side or another employed
infernal powers long ago - probably for the civil war itself.
</p>

<p>
If elves wouldn't lean so hard on their symbolism maybe we'd know the
real truth.
</p>

<p>
Elves forget slowly, and for generations to stop passing on their
inherited hatreds takes much longer than the rest of us, but there are
signs of healing. Minheimia lends its scouts and naturalists to aid the
Bel'aheldan borders with Tentaku.

The melting pot nation of Nomasgard share a close alliance with
Bel'aheldan. Duranae's use of magic in the city's foundation itself
has attracted the high wizards of Bel'aheldan since the nations have
recorded history of each other. Nomasgard's arcanists similarly
frequent to the capital of Cendwar to delve into more magical secrets.
</p>

<p>
Wizards from both cities can easily afford the teleportation fees.
</p>

<p>
Nomasgard and Bel'aheldan share defensive duties amongst Tentaku's
southeastern borders. Both elven blade and bow-work are passed onto the
troops there, and combative casters can put their magical theories to
the test. Can you imagine how dangerous magical studies would be if
they were practiced indoors with nothing but the citizenry nearby? I
shudder to think of the property damage.

The chief export of Bel'aheldan is magic - in a sense. Wizards can be
chartered to perform great magical acts, give advice on arcane matters,
create magical artifacts, and some suggest the capture and storage of
weapons too powerful for individuals or even nations to responsibly
bear.
</p>

<p>
In turn Bel'aheldan seeks magics to supplement their own arts. The state
itself pays handsomely for moonstone. Officials whisper when there is
enough moonstone accumulated to have a statue of every high elf, all the
high elves will depart the realm and take on a new form that is one of
raw magic, and they shall live in the weave itself.

elvish. Minheimia claims to have splintered from Bel'aheldan in a civil

high elves staring at each other at what is now the border between the
two, and not a drop of blood.

Minheimia is a beautiful land with lush grasslands broken by dense
forests with proud trees. Spire Fur trees grow to enormous heights and
cast out wide branches. Much of the forests, including the capital of
Kep Aelar itself, are covered by a canopy that leaves everything dark,
like a deep overcast without the gloom. At least most of the time. Some
places in those forests instill some primal fear - like every branch is
an outreached arm, and every shadow conceals eyes that stare upon you
with dreadful malice.

<p>
Even the mountains to Minheimia's eastern side are covered in lush
plant life. The Ring River between Minheimia and Nomasgard is said to
look like moving glass.

buildings with no roofs - sometimes they have more complicated

under the stars or the trees. Some have dirt or leaf litter for
flooring. Generally if some elves want a private conversation, they
either go for a walk or write in the dirt to one another.

One structure of note is the arena of Kep Aelar, which suggests a savage

Records exist of a war when the simple southwestern folk of Nomasgard
began a lumbering project that went unchecked. Though still Nomasgard
territory, the scout-trackers of Minheimia learned of this and began
humiliating the lumberjacks of the area. Humiliation then turned to
injury. Eventually injury gave way to death. A war was started.
Nomasgardian forces were dispatched, and though blood was shed on both
sides, Nomasgard shed the most. In an act of frustration the forces
were split and went to set fire to the trees as a way of injuring the
elves. The original lumber project was forgotten, and only vengeance
was what the humans had appetite for. The wood elves record that,
without any prompting on their end, gnomes of the local area -
presumably living in or under these trees - baffled the humans with
illusions and caused the humans to set fire to their own crops! The
humans eventually learned to touch a tree before burning it. The elves
surrendered to spare a forest that wasn't even theirs. The Nomasgard
general was a practical one, and conscripted the elves to help them
push the borders of Tentaku back on the Nomasgard front. They
accomplished their goal, but all of the scout-trackers perished.
</p>

<p>
Today Minheimia and Nomasgard live in peace and have better outlines of
territory and respect for the land. A descendant of the general gave
the land won by the scout-trackers to Minheimia. Nomasgard forces hold
it to this day, but Minheimians are considered sovereigns to that odd
speck of territory. Some of the relatives of the scout-trackers travel

Gazgren is far from the bulk of Minheimia, but the grave sites near
Tentaku are not. The hatred of orcs and elves is well known enough for
a silly goblin to tell you. The hobgoblins planned an ambush for the
main remembrance day at the grave site, and upon executing it were able
to capture all of the elves there. Just as their relatives were pushed
to conscription, so too were these elves compelled by the goblinoids to
fight for territory and spoils for the goblinoid armies. They initially
performed well, and earned much trust from the goblinoids from
consistent results. The hogoblin commanders promised freedom once the
next camp was taken, but the promise was remade again for yet another
camp, and so on. Not being a group of just scout-trackers, these
elves were able to fool the hobgoblins into approaching an orc
stronghold thinking its defenders dead and spoils ready for the taking.
The orcs thought themselves to be reinforced by a neighboring tribe
that was weaker and understood who was really in charge. Both parties
were caught by surprise when the veil was removed. Inside the camp the
fight was brutal. The few survivors were swiftly dispatched by the wood
elves, and they razed the camp. A war wagon piled with orc ears and
hobgoblin heads was found deserted in Gazgren's territory just outside
of Tentaku. The hogoblins received the message that the elves would not
be used in such a way again.

One topic any two kinds of elves can agree on is hatred of orcs.
Minheimia sends small parties of its ranging and naturalist troops to
help watch the southeastern borders of Tentaku. They also have members
that help watch Tentaku's easter fronts, and watch over their burial
shrines. That area is technically under Minheimia's jurisdiction, but
Nomasgard bolsters its forces and the Nomasgardians sent there benefit
from training of how to live off the land, scout unseen, and talk to
chipmunks.

The elves would never allow me to journey with them, but I was able to
present myself as a transfer to the Nomasgardian troop posted there. I
learned how to find berries! I am unsure why Nomasgard continues to
send troops specifically for training and patrol duties. How can you
fend off orcs with berries?

The relationship between dwarves and elves is a strange one. Dwarves
seem to have a respect for the more practical elven crafts, even if
they might scoff at parts of the design. It's hard to tell if they are
competing with each other or there is some rivalry that goes back to
ancient, unwritten times. Glintstrad uses the Road of Bones as a major

The star Valan comes from the elven word for "judge". Every 43 years the star
grows to take up a size that is about a quarter of the moon. The most peak time
of it lasts for about one month, which the elves call "Sque valan"; elven for
"judgment rendered" or "reparations", depending on the inflection. It is bright
enough to leave a faint deep red glow at night.
</p>

<p>
It also has a unique property in that it has a baffling effect on creatures with
darkvision. Their darkvision simply doesn't work in those 30 or so days. The
elves say that this is Valan coming to judge those arrogant enough to walk in
the night. Those who have darkvision describe their sight in the dark as being a
red that seems impossibly dim but strains the eyes as if it were intensely
bright.
</p>

<p>
What's also interesting is that this effect applies even to things that are
shielded from the light of Valan, and even during the day when Valan is no where
to be seen. Creatures that dwell underground cannot see at all and must rely
upon other senses. Underground creatures fall into two rough categories: One is
hibernation. For others, they go to the surface. This makes for a very chaotic
time indeed! Most civilized regions have provisions and guards to handle this.
Other, more remote areas will either go into their basements or temporarily
seeks shelter in places that do have defenses. In Gyoro, it is a capital offense
to refuse shelter to any of the goodly races during this 30 day period.

Some have said that Valan is actually another sun that dances in the
cosmos with our sun in a double-eclipse where the suns come very close to
each other, narrowly miss, and then fling each other way. This absurdity
should be dismissed outright. Clearly you can see that Valan is present
only at night, and our sun only present at day.

<p>
There are historic paintings that show Valan side by side with the sun
during the day. This is assured to be the artistry of a lunatic though!

The tribes-people of Egalstan remember where Valan was when they were born
and prescribe characteristics to themselves. They use this to determine
compatibility during courtship, among other things.
</p>

<p>
Nomasgard sends troops of its armies to known caves and builds fires to
lure out creatures that are otherwise blind to everything else. This
becomes a killing field, and many trophies are gathered during this time.
It's considered a sort of reward for many soldiers, and a way to blend
different units together to trade stories, techniques, drinks, and to even
"work off steam". Though no steam is produced. I am sorry to say, my
friend, I was not able to find any dealings with steam in my readings or
talking to elders of this affair. I shall endeavor to be of strong mind
and health for my next Sque Valan so I can report back more!
</p>

<p>
The orcs of Tentaku believe Valan to be the eye of Gruumsh coming closer
to see that the orcs are worthy. This incites them to aggressive action.
Armies are said to repel their attacks, but many, sneakier orcs manage to
slip by and wreak havoc in the bergs behind the army lines. Even with a
chaotic countryside, the orcs numbers dwindle rapidly from losses of
fighting. After Valan recedes, those near Tentaku celebrate.
</p>

<p>
Gazgren's goblinoids do the opposite of the orcs, and will set aside their
internal differences. Leaders of the legions dine with one another and
speak of greater conquests for Maglubiyet. The years that follow are
sorrowful for Gazgren's neighbors.
</p>

<p>
The elves of Bel'aheldan use this time to get in more meditation time and
self reflect upon the last 43 years. They make new resolutions to better
themselves, or begin a new task. Some will use this time to more deeply
explore their romance lives. Many of their tales of love center around
this time. But elven romance novels are so boring! They just stare at each
other for pages and pages!

The rugged people of Vyxt use Sque Valan to hunt great beasts that trouble
their lands, or could trouble their parched lands, for that matter.

<p>
It is commonly known that the nation of Vyxt is a majority of dragonborn
citizens. Legend has it that this was at one point the home of dragons.
Vyxt is syntactically very close to the draconic word "vyskarix", which
closely translates to "home" in the common tongue. The dragons would
fight amongst each other and their losses became great. The dragons
agreed to leave each other alone and allow lesser creatures to handle
their squabbles while the dragons bathed in piles of riches in peace.
</p>

<p>
If you believe that pile of rubble, let me go on: It is said that Tiamat,
the evil queen of dragons, birthed the first kobolds by hatching her eggs
prematurely. Tiamat's estranged lover, Bahamut, had sequestered some of
the same eggs for himself, and incubated the dragonborn from them. Both
races spread across the land of Vyxt, and brought riches to their dragon
lords as homage. Happy dragons meant intact villages.
</p>

<p>
At some point, a powerful red dragon backed by a conniving green dragon
and a devious blue dragon positioned themselves as the most powerful
dragons of Vyxt. From there they claimed rulership over the dragonborn,
and the world itself entered a dark age.
</p>

<p>
The dragonborn clans, for both better and worse, boast their lineage back
to such times. Many clans allied themselves to the chromatic dragons and
benefited greatly. Some worked in secret to help eventually overthrow the
chromatic dragons. Today the dragonborn clans don't see things as allies
of good and evil as you and I might see it. Instead the clans aligned
with chromatics are seen as loyal, yet simple. The clans aligned against
the chromatics are seen as intelligent, but scheming. There are of course
exceptions and these sweeping generalizations primarily exhibit
themselves when dragonborn gossip much like those in Egalstan do about
the phase of the red star they were born under. It also comes out in
ceremonies between the nobles of the dragonborn courts. The traits of a
clan are used as a kind of honorific, and those traits are said to hail
back to an age when the dragons ruled, and the dragonborn were but
servants to the dragons.

<p>
The dragonborn courts are a sight to behold. Everything that is dragonborn
is impressively big. Their ceilings rise high, and tapestries must be
equally long. The artisanship lacks the flare you see in the sturdy
dwarven stonework or fine elven ornaments.
</p>

<p>
The royalty of Vyxt allowed me to sit in on their court proceedings and a
aspiring ambassador explained all of the nuances to me. It was a very
straightforward affair. Usually I have to sneak in and remain hidden for
these sorts of things! Although I will say, dragonborn court servants make
lousy grape peelers. They just gave them to me mashed!

<p>
When using charms and other lures to get a loose tongue, the Vyxtians
warm up fastest with proper use of their clan titles than exotic trinkets
or the sounds of coins rubbing together.
</p>

<p>
When speaking to each other their clan heritage comes out in formal,
structured ways that give respects to the formally acknowledge strengths
of the clan. Dragonborn use a subtle pre-title as a means of indicating
peacefulness or goodwill, and it is always respectful. For example, The
Scherix clan is known to be fair. The honorific form of Scherix is "Fair
Scherix" in the common tongue. Dragonborn even love it when their clan
honorific is used in another tongue such as common. It gives them a
little flavor over their one-word complement they receive by showing its
various subtleties and color from other languages. To show even a common
dragonborn their honorific when addressing them never goes unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
To use the dragonborn clan's negative honorific is to be abrasive,
insulting, or even aggressive in an imminent way. Like the positive
honorific, it never goes unnoticed, and is never spoken in jest, no matter
how familiar you might be with the dragonborn or their clan. This leads to
many conflicts with other races where respect and bonding is communicated
in ways that are very complex to the dragonborn. Using our example of
Scherix, they are known to be greedy. The negative honorific is "Greedy
Scherix".
</p>

<p>
If you try to make up a negative honorific (like "Wasteful Scherix"), it's
confusing and comes off as non-sequitur. While the dragonborn might
understand that you're trying to insult them, the feeling of just how off
your statement is will overpower that, generally.
</p>

<p>
Leaving off an honorific has an interesting interaction. Dragonborn are
very direct in their social dealings. Leaving off the honorific in their
clan name means you know their clan, but you don't wish to honor or
dishonor it. You don't really wish anything with it at all. It
communicates an indifference that other races might be insulted by. For
dragonborn it simply means you have no immediate desire to strengthen a
relationship with them (friend or foe). It's generally used when
communicating with strangers or talking about trade matters.

talking about how they come from some forgotten age! Bah! But the stories

<p>
Dragonborn are hulking, brutish creatures and have monstrous appetites
compared to the other goodly races. Vyxt's primary import is food, and
for their own food it tends to be primarily meat. Meat is the filler
ingredient in their dishes, with other nutrients being wrapped or stuffed
in the meat almost apologetically. Vyxt's deserts don't leave much
fertile land for tilled fields and wheat. Instead Vyxtian farms are
mostly for raising indigenous desert livestock, such as any large
serpents, also small serpents, cows, goats, pigs, and rarely giant
insects. It's not uncommon for Vyxtian ranchers to be skilled warriors
out of necessity of their trade.
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend pork-wrapped viper sauteed in (giant) scorpion venom.
As a national delicacy goes, it does not disappoint! It should be noted
that elves might want to try a different dish, due to the hallucinogenic
properties of the venom on elven physiology. This is no recreational
hallucinogen but instead tends to provoke violent actions from the
consumer.

All aspects of the Vyxt armies involve some kind of magical assault.
Scouts learn both simple spells to move faster or help themselves remain
hidden. The rank and file troops learn simple attack spells or even
spells that augment their brute strength. Shock troops pick up defensive
spells that make their forms hard to make out, or minor teleportation
spells to get in and out quickly. Drake riders learn spells that anchor
their flying prey so the ground units can finish them off. Even the lowly
gate wall guards learn spells of compulsion and detection to spot thieves
and contraband; Though they did use this to determine I had fine nymphish
pipeweed on hand and confiscated it! I had intended to use that pipeweed
to give to the general. It would've relaxed her to the point of letting
me see how their mysterious black claws operate.

The citizens of Vyxt are hardy, strong, and proud. They lack many of the
creature comforts you and I know of. For them, life is a trial to prove
oneself. They are less likely to use contraptions and devices to make
life easier. However Vyxt invests much in sorcerous studies. Unlike the
utility and art of Bel'aheldanii magical works, Vyxtian magic is
primarily studied for combat and those spells that promise high value in
war are prioritized. Even in times of peace, the Vyxt believe that the
next war is around the bend. Any dragonborn will tell you that casting
off the dragon rule was a cost they don't wish to pay a second time.

<p>
One should be careful about asking about such things. My assistant
Valaria was fingered to the authorities and immediately detained by some
of Bahamut's order. When dealing with strict authorities such as those in
Vyxt, it is important to use proxies to gather information as I have.
Imagine if I had my papers confiscated! Sometimes I wonder what happened
to Valaria. She was always a clever conversationalist, and loyal to the
end I am absolutely sure. Still, better to leave the area just in case.

<p>
The primary deities worshiped in Vyxt are Bahamut and Tiamat - the dragon
gods of the pantheon. The dragonborn relationship with dragons is a
complicated one. They hate the dragons for enslavement, but derive
incredible pride in themselves and, as part of themselves, their draconic
heritage. Dragons represent power to them; Sometimes terrible, and
sometimes wonderful.
</p>

<p>
While Tiamat is known to be a god of evil, the dragonborn see a
practicality in that evil when it comes to war. In their view, killing is
never a good thing, but it is sometimes (or oftentimes, depending on
which dragonborn you're talking to) necessary. Instead of worshiping her
for evil purposes, they instead venerate her aspect of vengeance and
wealth - to match the needs of war and the benefit of spoils from that
war. In the mind of a Vyxtian, leaving the spoils is just wasteful, and
even disrespectful to the dead. Paladins of Tiamat are employed as
warrior-generals of their armies, and an order of them comprises one kind
of their elite strike forces.
</p>

<p>
Bahamut is revered by almost all nobles. His followers comprise most of
the churches of healing, and their holy knights help police internal
affairs of Vyxt. If there is a traitor in their midst, the holy knights
of Bahamut work tirelessly to root them out. Bahamut's holy knights can
detect magical auras and even sense lies. It is important to gather the
unfettered truth when compiling these works of mine. To evade these
powers it is good to be in a place where a magical aura already exists,
or be ready to create your own with blessed holy water or druidic
berries - items which seem innocent enough but baffle such detection. I
have heard other writers carry a talking doll or illusory pocket
paintings to ensure the schools of magic shown are expected. Rest assured
that my techniques are much more advanced than these ideas that were
surely thought up on a short wagon ride.
</p>

<p>
Worshipers from both sides accept Bahamut and Tiamat's relationship as a
complex one, much as the dragonborn themselves have a complex
relationship with dragons. Worshipers of one dragon deity will show
respect and sometimes even act in partnership with the deity of the
other.

<p>
One such war was fought mostly underground - the dwarves had dug their
tunnels far into Vyxtian territory and they happened upon preserved
dragon hordes from ancient times. The dwarves had pilfered much by the
time the horde-guards had spotted them. The Vyxt do not act kindly when
one uses a pick to pry the gemstones out of their history. While the
dwarves were in their primary terrain, the dragonborn were fighting with
a cause they felt righteous. The dwarves were beaten back and they left
empty handed. Today there is a treaty in place declaring clearly that
the borders between the two extend underground as well. Maps have been
drawn showing such caverns. Though one expects such boundaries are hard
to enforce, and a dwarf would be a fool to call out for Vyxtian guards
upon arriving in a large dragon horde and the owner nowhere to be seen.

<p>
Long ago, Cyorro was duped by a clever dragon into laying siege to an
area of worthless sand in Vyxt territory. The dragonborn didn't put up
much of a fight for that area, and lost much territory in this process.
Today Cyorro has offered some of that land back in reparation, but the
spoils are gone forever - probably hidden near the basements and attics
of many a warrior's inheritors. Legend has it that the dragon sought a
dark green orb with power to bring back the dead or capture souls for
strange and mostly unknown soul magic. I just wish I could blame a
crafty green dragon for anything the dragonborn authorities didn't like!

<p>
Across the Valiant Sea, Nomasgard is the closest sea-based state to
Vyxt, and much trading is done there instead of traversing Glintstrad -
depending on where the good are coming from. Nomasgard, Glintstrad, and
Vyxt all donate a pool of patrol fleets, which are even cross-staffed
between the nations of Nomasgard and Glintstrad. Still, Vyxt keeps a
navy of its own. Self sufficiency is vital to the dragonborn, and they
view slavery in many forms - alliances and politics potentially being
another kind.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--golani-grumsvelt's-guide-to-dirshum--vyxt-and-dragonborn--external-affairs--pirates">
<p>
Dragonborn pirates operate large vessels instead of smaller and faster
ones. They are escorted by a convoy and while they can't always catch
trade ships, they can corral their victims or even take on lightly
guarded trade ships. The navies usually can only track such ships from
their smaller reconnaissance vessels. Any good dragonborn captain will
have a sorcerer onboard to hide its location or even completely relocate
the ship. This keeps the pirates at large and still having much larger
ships for large hauls and a sort of base of operations from which other
pirates strike out.
</p>

<p>
It is said an order of dragonborn is maintained who seek wizardry from
the elves of Bel'aheldan. Not all dragonborn can easily harness their
dragonic heritage for sorcerous powers. However, the costs of such a
journey for an individual are many, especially for a lone trip. Typically
only the nobility can afford the trips, let alone the steep costs of such
tutelage. These warrior-wizards are said to be represented in every
clan - a way of stating that the dragonborn embrace their draconic
heritage by choice rather than necessity.

Self proclaimed lore master of Dirshum, Grumsvelt is a wanderer at heart.
He's been to every major city in the known world, and some rumor that he's
made it a point to stay at least one night in every berg in the world as
well. Before Duranae's mishap, he had written much on Dirshum. Books of
his can be found in sitting rooms, waiting areas, libraries, and inns -
all with the letters "GG" prominently traced in brass upon the cover.
Having lived around or in Dirshum, your characters would know much about
the city. This primer would tell you much if you were an outsider

Maia's gold was stolen with a debit on his ledger indicating "goblins". The

Grot says he went to the goblin sneaky school and spent a sizable amount of
money (wooden currency) on it. He says the goblins steal metal currency and give
it to their goblin king in exchange for wooden currency, because metal currency
has no value among goblins.

<p>
The party continued to Monrithon. They encountered Cylge Ironsworth, a fellow
servant of the Circle of Piety. Cylge had heard of Maia via reputation, and told
them about the murder of the constable in the town. He also stated the road has
been safe so far and wanted to know if it was safe going the other way. The
party warned about potential dangers but that things were otherwise safe. Clyge
and the party continued their separate ways.
</p>

<p>
A small, painted wooden flower was seen planted on the side of the road.
Suspecting a potential goblin attack, the party left behind the family they'd
saved (under the guise that they needed to pick up the pace to meet their
deadline) and pushed faster towards Monrithon. They even traveled through the
night, found more wooden flowers, and pushed on through morning.
</p>

<p>
The party then encountered a gray door in the middle of the road. The door
opened to reveal one Billy the Gray (or Billy Gray as his friends call him). He
described himself as a traveling salesman of magical wares. The party declined
seeing any goods in his shop. Billy Gray gave out two blue sapphires to the
party to summon him, should the party ever change their mind. The party left,
and later threw the sapphires into the grasslands.
</p>

<p>
The party then arrived in Monrithon. Vaux and Venn went drinking. Maia and Silks
performed the Witness of the Dead on the constable, and witnessed the constable
being murdered by Venn.
</p>

<p>
The session ended just as the witnessing was complete.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-5">
<p>
Venn passed out in a drinking competition with Vaux.
</p>

<p>
After the witnessing, Maia and Silks attempted to get a handle on the situation
with witnessing Venn perform the murder. It didn't go well with acting constable
Cabby. Cabby called a guard and wanted to bring them in for questioning, but the
party insisted they would better investigate on their own. What was going in for
questioning turned into arrest, and the party gave the constabulary the slip.
Maia made it to the temple and reported the witnessing and the exchange with the
acting constable.
</p>

<p>
Vaux and Silks met up, and went to the dive bar in town. They rented a private
room and discussed plans/ideas. A message was delivered to their door. It
included the cost of renting the room. Eventually they came out, and saw a
half-orc sitting alone in the bottom bar area. The half orc tossed a sack of
money to them, and said his employer apologizes for their unwitting involvement
as a scapegoat, but also claimed it was a heft reimbursement. Also don't come
back, to keep things tidy. Vaux and Silks refused to take the money, and left.
Outside they eventually saw a dead body that was dumped in the street - the same
half orc they saw in the bar minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
Maia attempted to wake up Venn to no avail. Begrudgingly, he left Venn, but did
his best to help Venn be hidden.
</p>

<p>
Silks departed the city.
</p>

<p>
Vaux slipped into Maia's room and they synced up. They spent the night in the
temple. Upon waking (late in the morning), the temple had already worked out an
understanding with the constabulary. Maia and associates (but not Venn) were to
be pardoned but were to leave immediately. Separately, the temple of Pelor had a
casket to send back to Wentroad, and Maia's escort detail saves them some
resources. So they all go back together with the casket and Acolyte Femriel
Moonstaff - the priest that had accompanied Maia to the witnessing in the first
place.
</p>

<p>
Silks found some sapphires in the wild, but passed them up. Will we ever hear
from Silks again? Who knows.

<p>
The party (just Vaux and Maia) were leaving Monrithton. As the stable boy was
handing over the reigns to the horses, a zombie bit the boy. Zombies had also
breached the gates and were flooding in. Vaux and Maia began dispatching them.
</p>

<p>
Femriel called for the guards. The alarm sounded.
</p>

<p>
Venn had been stuffed in a coffin nailed to the underside of the wagon. He broke
out, took in the scene quickly, and began to fight with Vaux and Maia.
</p>

<p>
Gearion (spelling?) heard the commotion and joined in defending against the
zombie attack. Gearion saved the stable boy.
</p>

<p>
The guards (and later, Caddy) eventually showed up to lend a hand.
</p>

<p>
Just when the last door to the gate was about to close, a zombie ogre forced it
open, killing a guard and hurting another. Everyone focused on the ogre. The
ogre, seemingly talking as if a puppet master were pulling it's strings. The
ogre demanded to know who their champion was.
</p>

<p>
The goblins appeared to fire a volley of arrows at the ogre zombie. They
departed after Venn finished the ogre.
</p>

<p>
With no more zombies left, and Venn having entered a rage, he began to attack
everyone around him. A guard was injured (and later healed), and Vaux was
incapacitated. Eventually Venn collapsed of exhaustion.
</p>

<p>
Caddy demanded that Venn be kept in shackles under the watch of the party until
they left. Gearion and her argued about it for a bit, and it was decided that
the party sleep in the jail that night. Caddy accommodated as best she could.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, Caddy met with the party on their way out. She mentioned that
the guards at the watch posts were killed, which probably explains how they got
past the front gate. She's doubling the watch.
</p>

<p>
Caddy also mentioned how the local church of Pelor had given her some
information from confessions that deflected guilt on Venn and helped explain
some other things. There is definitely a crime ring they are hunting down.
</p>

<p>
Caddy told Venn they have had a fellow guard with a similar trauma and
unfortunately they had to put him down, but they really wish it turned out
differently. She did not require shackles to leave the town, but did escort
Venn.

<p>
Gearig and Venn visited Billy Gray, whose shop appeared to be setup in
Monrithon. Billy Gray gave them amber calling stones. The party offered their
services to Billy Gray. The arcanist offered a job to collect basilisk eggs. The
party agreed. Caddy led them to Hogar, a half-giant, exiled Egalstan tribesman
who lived just outside of town in a hut on a hill. They paid Hogar a fee to
guide them to the cave, and haul one of the statues out in the event they were
both petrified. Hogar also gave them some ointment that the basilisk would not
like the smell of.
</p>

<p>
Hogar helped lure a deer near the cave and trap it. Gearig assisted in guiding
the deer into the trap. Once the deer was trapped, the basilisk came out,
petrified the deer, and began to feast on its stone form.
</p>

<p>
Gearig gave a covering illusion to Venn, who snuck into the cave. Venn lit a
torch. Its sound was loud enough to attract the attention of the basilisk.
Gearig distracted the basilisk away with his magic, but the now-alert basilisk
found Gearig and began to petrify him.
</p>

<p>
Inside, Venn found two humanoid statues and six basilisk eggs. He pocketed the
eggs and came out of the cave to find the basilisk was engaged with Gearig's
familiar.
</p>

<p>
Venn managed to sneak up on the basilisk and grapple it. Between Venn's fists
and Gearig's magic, the basilisk was quickly defeated. Hogar had earlier stated
he'd prefer the basilisk weren't killed because of its economic value. The party
killed the basilisk anyways, and Hogar was witness to it. Hogar understood the
need to defend themselves, and heard about the other statues. He agreed with
their call.
</p>

<p>
The party summoned Billy Gray's door, and they brought the basilisk body
through, along with the statues.
</p>

<p>
Billy Gray gave the party 1200 for the eggs (200 each), and 500 for the basilisk
carcass. He promised to use some of the remains to produce an oil to cure
petrification from the victims, and gave an egg to Hogar to go raising
basilisks for basilisk eggs.
</p>

<p>
The party expressed interest in meeting the victims.
</p>

<p>
Billy Gray also offered a 10% discount on future wares.
</p>

<p>
Venn requested a night vision eye patch.

<p>
The party signed up to help Cabby out with a serious crime issue in Monrithon.
Maia was very driven to get to the bottom of this, as it threw some serious
doubt into the service Maia had been performing for so long.
</p>

<p>
Another witnessing was done for a recent murder. This time it was Maia who was
the murderer, or so it would seem.
</p>

<p>
One of the avenues was the stable boy - the same one who was saved during the
fight at the Monrithon gate. The stable boy didn't want to say much, and was in
serious fear for his life. The boy did give up a name: The Soiled Goat.
</p>

<p>
The Soiled Goat was actually the Spoiled Goat but the P fell to the side and
nobody bothered to repair it. This place was said to house the ring leader of
the criminal activity in Monrithon.
</p>

<p>
The party snuck inside through a back tunnel. They found a room where someone
had been practicing handwriting, and a series of trophies on display of various
objects whose shared value was unclear. From there they found the room ran into
the basement of the Soiled Goat.
</p>

<p>
Paranoia ran rampant. Allies tested each other. Nothing could be trusted.
</p>

<p>
And then Cabby with a couple of guards entered through the front of the Soiled
Goat, with a determined look and hands on pommels of their weapons.

<p>
Your adventure started in the tail end of summer as it recedes into fall.
During the prior winter, a traveling masque passed through Went Road. It was
hard not to succumb to the desire to be around a warm hearth, a drink to warm
the belly, and general merriment. The temptation was assuredness with a small
surplus of coin all of you happened upon independently.
</p>

<p>
Whether you're a skeptic or you look to the stars for guidance and structure,
the entertainment of having your collective fortune read was included in the
indulgences of the night. As the evening drew late and the ale did its work, you
all agreed to pay the fare and followed into the room the tavern had dedicated
for the activity.
</p>

<p>
Pitch black except for a lit table and a vaguely smiling shadow opposing to it,
the masque certainly knew how to set the a foreboding mood. Somehow the room
seemed far more vast than it should be when you couldn't see any of its walls,
ceiling or floor. As you moved to the table, one of your steps didn't have the
creak of boards the tavern is known for, but instead the grind of dirt at the
heel. Another the soft crunch of grass. Then creaking boards again. How many
ales was it now?
</p>

<p>
The light slowly grows just enough to show you the person at the table. Their
mouth makes a huge smile that doesn't look comfortable at all. The eyes hold a
sadness to them. There's generous amounts of makeup. The structure of the face
is rather androgynous. The voice is both obnoxious and sing-song. It's the voice
a children's nursery rhyme would make if it could speak for itself.
</p>

<p>
"I see before me a trio of power
a parting gift at this late hour
</p>

<p>
Each deeply entrenched in future and past
Only in the present are they held fast
</p>

<p>
Before me is a man whose half vision was left behind
The other half only left to look inside
There is where peace he will find
</p>

<p>
The other a miscreant with no past to see
Yore exploits and ruin are hidden from you and from me
</p>

<p>
Your history is yours to reclaim
But who is to say if it is ignominy or fame
</p>

<p>
And then the voice of those departed dearly
Whose connection is both powerful and eerie
</p>

<p>
Your voice preserves the justice of those who once were
Yet its origin comes from a mistress of all fate
A conduit for the will of her
</p>

<p>
First, let us follow the man's lost eyeball
On this day a bout was had.
Two men clashed, one would live and the other would fall."
</p>

<p>
There's a sudden feeling of wind billowing around you at unthinkable speed. The
table and the rhyming idiot zip away until you're in total blackness. A void
between everything, with no wind, or feeling, or sound. Then a rush of sudden
wind again. You find yourself in a sort of hut. You see your friends with you,
healthy and whole. Particularly Venn, who has his other eye back - something
you've never seen before.
</p>

<p>
Venn, this feels natural and everything with this seems right. This is the day
you have the fight where you will exchange your eye for another man's life. Your
friends are in your home with you. You feel compelled to step through the day's
events exactly how it happened. You also feel the ability to turn to your
friends and give them extra context. The world around you will wait until you
are done, so you can pick back up where you left off in this historical
"present". Your friends take no part in these events. They are only spectators
here to see your story.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to embellish! And if it feels uncomfortable now or later, just hand
the mic back and we'll move on to someone else. This is your chance to tell us
about your fight, why you did it, what you got out of it, how you and your
family felt about it both before, after, and during. Who is this man you defeat?
Why must you defeat him? How do you handle the loss of your eye?
</p>

<p>
The rest of you, think about parts of your characters you'd like to see this
trip cover. I don't have as much history for either of you that's immediately
notable (at least that I remember). Feel free to email me directly if you want
to hold the suspense!

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--sessions--session-9--public--venn's-fortune">
<p>
In the vast, untamed wilderness, two legendary tribes clashed in a
battle that would forever be etched in the annals of history. The
battle would ultimately be decided by a duel, and the decision on
which tribe reigns supreme over the North rested solely on the
shoulders of two champions. Venn, known for his unusual size, was a
fearsome tribesman from The Clan of the Fist. With his chiseled frame
and hardened demeanor, he was renowned for his unparalleled strength
and primal ferocity. "The Wolf Man," the champion of the Moon Tribe,
was an enigmatic figure, embodying the cunning and tenacity of his
namesake, and was more than ready to add another name to his list of
almost one hundred kills.
</p>

<p>
The fateful day arrived when the destiny of these two warriors
intertwined. The tribes assembled, eager to witness the clash of
titans. Venn, with a fiery determination burning within him, prepared
for the fight ahead. He stepped into the arena, his eyes brimming
with anticipation.
</p>

<p>
As the dust settled and the chants of the crowd reverberated through
the air, "The Wolf Man" emerged from the shadows, his eyes gleaming
with a predatory glint. His sinewy muscles rippled beneath his
wolf-skin garment, a testament to his deadly prowess. The spectators
gasped in awe, aware that they were about to witness a battle for the
ages. A true test between strength and agility.
</p>

<p>
The duel commenced with a primal roar, as Venn lunged forward, his
movements swift and relentless. The Wolf Man countered, evading
Venn's blows with agile grace. Their clash echoed through the arena,
the sound of flesh meeting flesh reverberating like thunder.
</p>

<p>
Venn's strength was unmatched, and with each strike, his fury burned
hotter. However, The Wolf Man's strategic cunning kept him on his
toes, weaving and dodging, striking back with calculated precision.
The fight was a whirlwind of raw power and tactical finesse, proof to
the unyielding spirit of both warriors.
</p>

<p>
Yet, fate had a cruel twist in store for Venn. In a fleeting moment
of vulnerability, The Wolf Man's razor-sharp dagger found its mark,
slashing across Venn's face, leaving a gruesome wound. Blood poured
forth, flowing from Venn's eye socket, earning him the haunting
moniker of "The Bloody Eye."
</p>

<p>
But something surged within Venn at that moment. As pain rushed
through his body and his vision became distorted, his tell-tale rage
gripped him, overpowering his senses. A wicked grin emerged on his
bloodied face, a reflection of the unhinged savagery that consumed
him.
</p>

<p>
With his remaining eye ablaze with a mixture of agony and
exhilaration, Venn unleashed a relentless assault upon his adversary.
He embraced the pain, allowing it to fuel his every strike. The crowd
watched in awe and horror as Venn, transformed into a force of
nature, tore into The Wolf Man with unmatched brutality. The Wolf
Man, caught by surprise from the sudden change in Venn's tempo,
caught a glancing blow from Venn's savage assault, throwing him off
balance. In an instance the fight was over. As The Wolf Man staggered
to recover from Venn's fist, Venn struck out with his hand and
grabbed The Wolf Man's throat. With a sickening rip, Venn tore out
The Wolf Man's wind pipe, and then tossed him aside, never once
letting the smiling-rage leave his face.
</p>

<p>
Venn emerged victorious, his body adorned with cuts and bruises, his
remaining eye glowing with an indomitable spirit. The once formidable
Wolf Man lay defeated at his feet, a testament to Venn's unparalleled
resilience and unrelenting savagery.
</p>

<p>
"The Bloody Eye" returned to his tribe, a legendary figure whose name
would be whispered with a mix of fear and reverence for generations
to come. The tribes would forever remember the day when Venn became
more than a man—a living embodiment of the untamed spirit of rage.

<p>
The figure turns its attention to Maia. Behind the maquillage, its
eyes take on pity. “You believe you pledged your power to her, for
her asking.” It cackles gratingly in self-amused irony. “Can you
truly give what was gifted? Or is the Giver merely taking back? I
should like to see the look on thy face! Come let us lift the veil,
little clerk!”
</p>


<p>
Again the gale, the dark, the void… then a small room flickering with
shadows, and a figure hunched over a desk.
</p>


<p>
A hawk-nosed young man, cheeks and temples still pink with blemish
scars from an adolescence of hygiene neglected for study, squints at
a thick book of ancestry by the light of too small a candle. His
expression is contorted by eye strain and impatience. He was called
to this profession by an overwhelming compassion for the disconsolate
dead and their bereaved. It's with them he wants to work, in serene
chapels, not with contracts and court records, in cramped closet
offices. Unfortunately for him, he excels at this type of
investigation. As a result, he has been assigned the most important
case commissioned to the Circle in many years: A branch of the royal
family with too many heirs has lost its matriarch to old age. On his
death bed the Duchess, a traditionalist, had commanded that a Witness
for the Dead should untangle the contentious succession and bade the
family abide by all findings. There is an urgency; apparently,
jealous siblings and cousins are devolving to violent threats.
</p>


<p>
A commotion in the office without. Then the little closet door bursts
open, hinges nearly popping. In the inadequate candlelight a startled
Maia sees only a bald head with a red face and a furious scowl,
smelling strongly of alcohol. “You the little shit doin’ our
heirship?” it barks. The intruder’s eyes fall on the book open on the
desk, and he has his answer. A hiss and glint of metal drawn. “I’ll
take that too!” The blade flicks at Maia.
</p>


<p>
Dying is easier than Maia would have guessed. By the time the pain
registers, it's already yielding to a warm, weightless caress. He is
being held, his head cradled, and he wonders if he is already reborn
a babe, and the Reincarnists were right all along. 
</p>


<p>
“Never again a babe,” answers a soft voice thick with fondness. He
opens his eyes, but it does not dispel the dream; framed in violet
clouds is a pale face featureless as porcelain, a chorus mask from a
tragic play. Featureless, yet roiling with passions
incomprehensible. 
</p>


<p>
“Nor, never again a man,” it continues through motionless lips. A
mask in truth. “But do not dwell, my champion. We will meet here
again, when you may consent to come. Then will answers find you.”
</p>


<p>
Maia had not acquired a tiny, windowless closet office off the lowest
canon’s own tiny office by being dull. “You’re speaking of
immortality.” He notices his own lips do not move. Is his face become
a mask too? Are they all masks here in the violet clouds?
</p>


<p>
Surging from the eyes infinite and black as starless night: yearning
mixed with joy mixed with resolution mixed with despair mixed with…
emotions for which the words were lost long ago. “And very much
more.”
</p>


<p>
It seems an education in contract law carries over with the soul,
because Maia inquires, “What do you ask in return?”
</p>


<p>
Add desire to the swell pouring forth. “Companionship.” Then
startling ferocity. “Loyalty.” Then a vast, vast compassion, which
awakens and resonates with Maia’s own deepest purpose. “Love.”
</p>


<p>
And Maia surprises himself by saying without hesitation, “I agree,”
for he feels within himself these things for this radiant being
already.
</p>


<p>
A thousand suns of joy, a nova of triumph. “Here, then, a gift for
your heart’s desire." As if a window were thrown open over a busy
street, Maia is suddenly aware of a cacophony of voices within the
clouds, which he somehow knows are spirits long or newly separated
from their corporeal lives.  "And now a fugue," she continues
smoothly, "so that when you come to me, your offer and pledge to me
may be genuine.”
</p>


<p>
A fugue? Maia nearly laughs. How could he possibly forget this?
Forget her?
</p>


<p>
Then he is standing in his tiny office in flickering candlelight. One
bloodied hand clutches the ivory handle of a letter opener, blade
embedded in the neck of the intruder, who is face-down on the desk,
motionless, and bleeding profusely over the book of ancestry and
everything else. Maia’s other hand is pressed against a gash on his
rib cage, which is gushing its own alarming volume of blood, though
perhaps not from anything critical.
</p>


<p>
“Maia!” barks another voice from the doorway, but this one is alarmed
rather than murderous. Maia tears his eyes from the gore to see the
horrified and bloodied face of a man in canon's robes, whose name he
knows he should remember&#x2026;. 
</p>


<p>
“He attacked me! Who is this person?” said the canon, now growing a
bit fuzzy at the edges. But Maia is inexplicably more concerned about
damage to the expensive letter opener, which is borrowed… before he
faints into a cloudless, maskless, proper dark.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-7" id="text-campaigns--era-of-eras--wand-of-woe--sessions--session-9--public--vaux's-fortune">
<p>
"Now for the Kenku", the fortune teller turns its knowing gaze toward
Vaux. "Your God knows much about justice, but does He think He can
truly bend fate? Does He know that this bird is as that man was?" The
void once again envelops the group. 
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
In the flickering candlelight of the church study, a middle-aged
human man emerges from the haze. Raven black hair intertwined with
glistening strands of silver, cascades down to frame a weathered
face. His piercing grey eyes follow the lines of the worn and dusty
Tomes of Pelor.
</p>

<p>
It's immediately clear to Vaux and Maia that this is Grifton, a
once high ranking Bishop who was disgraced and sentenced to death
during the previous Volonsquay. Despite his crimes, his visage still
hangs among the portraits of numerous other high order priests and is
studied by Pelor's Acolytes. Known as a charismatic and devout man,
he rose through the ranks of the church, earning the esteemed
position of Bishop. Tales of the common people depict him as a man
dedicated to his faith, who believed in the inherent goodness of
people and the church's mission to serve the needy. 
</p>

<p>
The image of Grifton rises from his desk, sends a nervous glance
around the room, then utters a few words that Vaux recognizes as
Infernal. The book springs alive, levitating from his outstretched
hands. A swirling portal materializes from within the pages, its
depths pulsating. Grifton then turns to unlock a chest at the other
end of his study, retrieving a weighty sack brimming with gold.
Hurriedly, he feeds fistfulls of the riches into the portal's maw,
coins vanishing into the abyss. With one final command in Infernal,
the portal collapses.The book, now once more an inanimate object,
settles gently back into Grifton's hands.
</p>

<p>
The haze pours into the room again, clouding the scene entirely. Once
the fog disperses, Vaux, Maia, and Venn find themselves among a
crowd, gathered around a gallows. A clergyman is reading rights
loudly for the crowd to hear, but pointed at a man bound with a noose
about his neck. Grifton lifts his noosed neck up to look out at the
crowd, eyes ablaze. 
</p>

<p>
The clergy crier continues on to describe Grifton's crime, which was
evidently years of stealing from the church of Pelor. 
</p>

<p>
"What final burdens will you relieve from your soul?" the crier looks
to Grifton, expectantly.
</p>

<p>
Grifton straightens and yells out to the crowd. "I die here today,
convicted of corruption against the church. But it is the church that
is the guilty one!" His eyes shift to the clergyman. "Pelor knows of
your earthly greed, your over taxation of the common people. They
starve as your pockets fatten. May Pelor judge you for your sins."
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The fog rolls in as the group hears the sound of the gallows trap
door releasing. Screams and cheers from the crowd fade as the fortune
teller's room comes back into focus.

"Once a thief, always a thief. Isn't that right, bird?" The fortune

I emerged from that grim theater back into the tavern, dazzled by the
lantern light as though I had just spent days in darkness. We three
stood in stricken silence while our minds reeled from the masque’s
onerous exhibits. Other seekers acknowledged our disorientation with
sympathetic faces, even as the next in line stepped around us,
impatient for their own revelations. Finally Venn sniffed the air,
muttered something, then fled towards the roasting pit; his means of
coping with discomfort were predictable and enviable. 
</p>


<p>
The masque’s display for Venn–his square-off with the Wolf Man, and
his injury–was not news to me. During our tour of his ravaged
homeland, Venn had told me that story, and many others, to distract
from the horrors of our mission. What he had left out, and the masque
had revealed, was that his renowned battle-lust had once been a tool
and a joy for a clever young fighter, not the possessing, treacherous
rage that burdened him now. I could guess when the transformation
must have occurred. While I had not known Venn before his life’s
tragedy, I knew that the murder of his clan had changed him, as it
would anyone. Anguish and impotent fury had surely twisted his
aggression into the beast I spent so much of my talent helping him
contain. Perhaps the masque sought to remind Venn of more innocent
days when he controlled the tempest. I hoped he would find a path
back to that power. I never begrudged the divine help I lent my
friend, but it was a fraught solution. 
</p>


<p>
I expected Venn would disappear for a few weeks, as he often did when
something upset him. But I was confident that, as always, he would
reappear at my office door, chipper and uncomplicated, mouth full of
muffins from downstairs, smelling of grass and campfires. Venn would
be all right.
</p>


<p>
I was not so sure about Vox, my introverted and mysterious friend. I
turned to say something to him, but he was already making for the
dark hallway that led to the shady rooms reserved for his ilk.
Seeking solitude, I hoped, and not the distractions of vice. The lore
was true, then: Kenku, or at least our Kenku, are the way they are by
means of a curse. Did Vox know about his former incarnation (I
presumed that is who we had just met) before the masque’s vision? If
not, then the revelation was cruel. When I saw him again I would
assure him that his friends would never judge him for his past. Do we
not have our own skeletons? And I would make him understand that
curses are like diseases: there’s often a cure, if you can only
uncover it. I would offer to look for books on his situation, if he
wanted.
</p>


<p>
But I had my own shock to face first. My own… betrayal. (But, was it
Her fault that I had assumed my vel alma talents were innate? And now
I must face that she had chosen me not for who I am, but for what She
had made me. What was I if not an equal? A servant? A pet?) I needed
to… think? Meditate? Neither sounded appealing. But I could not
endure another moment in this muggy, noisy tavern.
</p>


<p>
I made my escape and beelined for the bakery and my office, grateful
for the quiet twilight and nearly empty streets. The commercial
district was all but abandoned. Shops that would normally be open on
a seasonably warm evening like this were closed for the masque
holiday, including the bakery. So I was surprised to find the back
entrance unsecured. I locked it behind me, climbed the narrow stairs,
and yelped as I nearly collided with Silks’ brooding silhouette in
the hallway. His glinting eyes bore the sharp disdain he spared no
mortal. No doubt judging me for allowing myself to be ambushed. I had
long ago stopped taking Silk’s criticisms personally, but tonight his
poor timing grated.
</p>


<p>
“A bit late for a visit,” I snapped as I sidestepped him. I turned
the knob up on the hallway lantern and began searching pockets for
the office key.
</p>


<p>
“It’s unlocked,” he let me know. 
</p>


<p>
“Yet I distinctly remember locking both my office and the exterior
door on my way out this morning. It’s a mystery!”
</p>


<p>
He refused to be goaded, and let me push open my office door to
discover his gift: a cloth-wrapped corpse in a heap on the floor. I
sighed and knew I did not need this right now. “Silks, you can’t
bring these here, I’ve said it before. This is my office. And a
bakery, I’ll add. There are health regulations.”
</p>


<p>
“Morgue’s closed,” he answered.
</p>


<p>
“It isn’t!”
</p>


<p>
“It is. The ridiculous holiday. And I don’t want to wait ‘til
tomorrow. I think it’s reaching the limit.”
</p>


<p>
The odor coming from the rags told me he was probably right. “Why
would they close the morgue of all places?” I argued testily, even as
I knelt and placed a hand on the wrapped head. “Does death take a
holiday?” Silks intuited I was addressing no one and waited silently.
The body’s spirit was faint and far, but not unreachable. “All right,
let’s do it now,” I conceded. “Then, please remove the deceased to
the Circle temple. They can stow it in the mortuary until the morgue
reopens. Tell them I said so.” I looked up at the crossed-armed rogue
and took my revenge where I could. “Since the morgue’s closed, you’ll
have to write the corroborating affidavit.” I drove the knife home:
“It has to be thorough.” 
</p>


<p>
Silks made a dour face that proved he had not considered that. I did
not wait for his protest but began the ritual. I left the wrappings
in place. Flesh-to-flesh contact would provide a more vivid
witnessing, but the thought of dealing with this spirit’s mournful
confusion on top of my own repulsed me. Yet as I said the prayers,
doubt nipped at me. Now that I had discovered the secret source of my
talent, would it still work? Did my knowledge of the truth violate
some other unremembered covenant? Could She take my talent… Her gift…
back? I stumbled briefly in the liturgy. What would I be if not a
Witness vel alma? ‘A witness still, only in a different tiny office,’
I answered myself, and felt a little better for the truth of it. I
continued my prayers.
</p>


<p>
At the prescribed turn, Silks put a hesitant hand on my shoulder–I
knew he hated this part more than anybody. Now, he would experience
his kill from the perspective of his quarry. How unsettling that must
be. But I was used to dying by Silk’s hand; I had been vicariously
killed by the rogue a dozen times, and I was only grateful his
efficiency with assassins’ tools often foreshortened his prey’s
suffering. I braced myself and reached for the spirit of the
deceased. Silence descended, stealing even our heartbeats. Shadows
spread like spilled ink from the recesses of the room. Lamplight
retreated, soon replaced by the last light the deceased had seen
before his death: a flickering campfire in some secluded grotto. (So,
my talent was intact.) I felt Silks shudder, but he tightened his
grip on my shoulder in self-defiance. 
</p>


<p>
The session was brief and irrefutably incriminating. Minutes before
Silks’ lethal bolt found the base of his skull, our callous subject
had been gloating with co-conspirators over the very crimes for which
he had been bountied, even while shoveling the last bit of dirt over
whatever gruesome evidence he had hoped to conceal thereby. Silks and
I spent a tedious hour writing our affidavits, then I bid him fulfill
his end of the bargain. He gathered the paperwork and slung the
corpse over his shoulder. “Tithe your share at the temple, I assume?
” 
</p>


<p>
“Please,” I answered. “Goldleaf and silk don’t come cheap. I think
our priests eat it for lunch the way it disappears.” I signed a
second note and handed it to him. “Will you please give this to a
Circle cleric when you drop off the body?”
</p>


<p>
He glanced at the paper and raised an eyebrow. “Tonight? Are you
unwell?” 
</p>


<p>
“I’m well. But, a cleric please, not a priest or anyone else. And it
occurs to me, I’m sure I saw the entire constabulary in queue for the
masque this evening, so you’ll have to drop off the affidavits
tomorrow.”
</p>


<p>
“Asinine holiday,” he grumbled.
</p>


<p>
I shrugged, not quite agreeing. “Most everyone wants to see the
masque when they pass through. It takes a couple days to get through
the queue. And a lot of folks need time to recover from their
sessions." Myself among them. "So they make it a holiday.”
</p>


<p>
“Seems bad for business.”
</p>


<p>
“Very. You should have a session,” I invited unseriously. “What
revelation might the masque offer our stoic bounty hunter, I wonder?”
I winked, but Silks had a thoughtful look.
</p>


<p>
After a moment he said, “What, indeed? Perhaps I’ll go see this
masque.”
</p>


<p>
I was genuinely astonished. “Really?”
</p>


<p>
He bared his sharp teeth in his best approximation of a smile. “No.”
</p>


<p>
“Oh go away.” As he retreated down the hallway, I called after him,
“a cleric, remember!”
</p>


<p>
The stench of decay was in the floorboards where the corpse had lain.
I thought I should use my juniper oil before the proprietor arrived
in the morning and tore the place apart looking for whatever had died
in the walls again. But the macabre odor set the mood for my planned
meditation. 
</p>


<p>
I had prayed to Her countless times, to beseech and receive Her
favors, which She granted generously. And rarely, She had reached out
to me of Her own volition, in signs and omens and enigmatic dreams.
But I had never sought communion with Her as I had seen in the
masque’s vision. I had not known to try. 
</p>


<p>
I sought it now. I lit a candle on my desk, then fetched my razor and
washing bowl from the bedroom nook. I sat cross-legged on my little
threadbare rug, and set the bowl in my lap. I pulled up a sleeve and
lay my arm over it, soft side up. I felt no trepidation; I had been
through this process countless times, even if not in my own body.
With my free hand I gripped the razor and drew it down the tender
belly of my forearm, crook to wrist, as deeply as strength and
willpower allowed. I did not say a prayer as my lifeblood drained
from me. I was not calling Her to me but coming to Her; I knew no
prayers for that. In the masque's memory, I had not even the
intention. As the dark pool rose against the patina of the cold brass
bowl, I hoped, with a pang of anxiety, that my impulsivity was not a
mistake. Once, She had caught my sinking soul, brought it to Her
bosom, and saved me… if the masque had shown true. Did I believe she
would do so again? 
</p>


<p>
Nothing for it now. Emptiness had found me.

<p>
We can leave the Winter Fortune Telling series as done here. That way we
aren't balancing two stories progressing at the same time. But you folks
want another chance to do a dive like this, let me know and we'll spin
another one!
</p>

<p>
The cut on your arm hurts, but after a while it begins to dull. The false cold
from your draining life washes over you slowly. Thoughts begin to fog. One
thought is sharper than the rest: doubt.
</p>

<p>
A sharpness comes. You're more aware of the room again, and you realized you
left the door open. Carelessly? Had Silks returned and found you in this place?
</p>

<p>
Someone is standing in the room, their ingress obviously owed to the ajar door.
The silhouette is feminine, but hazy. A porcelain mask adorns her face. It is
fixed forever in melancholy. In the dark candle light of your room, the mask is
the only detail besides an outline that you can get. Despite the mask forever in
a single expression, you can feel something behind the mask - concern.
</p>

<p>
She approaches you and bends down. At first you think it is to tend to your arm.
The mask gets very close. She reaches not for your arm, but for your heart. From
it, she traces a silver thread. As her fingers move along it, it becomes visible
to you. With a flick, the remainder of the thread reveals itself. It floats away
from you like gossamer in the wind. But it doesn't go much further.
</p>

<p>
Your eyes focus on what's distant. No longer are you in your room but instead
among many other silvery lines on a background of darkness. At first you think
of a spider's web, but the pattern is much different. This is a weave. A fabric
made where many lines come together and swirl about from each other, each making
stronger ropes of twisted silver. Many are frayed in places, or explode out
completely like rope that couldn't bear the load. It occurs to you that these
are severed from the collective, much like yours.
</p>

<p>
The mask, which is all you can see now in this darkness, drifts over to the end
of your thread. You see the faint outline of body and hands once again from her.
She pulls the thread tight and reconnects it with one that is floating. She
releases the thread - it twangs deeply like the sound of a heartbeat and warmth
floods your body once more. Your body feels alive again. Your heartbeat sends
little pulses of vibration through your silver thread.
</p>

<p>
The mask has not finished with you. She reaches for your face and removes your
mask. The mask of Maia. Maia's mask had a veil upon it. With the mask removed,
you no longer see threads glowing in the dark, but lines of time and fate. Each
thread has drifting moments of lives of people captured in perfect curation.
Some of the threads closest to you are your friends and those you frequent the
most. You see their births. You see their most vulnerable moments. Their deepest
shames. You see their deaths that are yet-to-be. It's too much. Your heart races
with this impossible knowledge, and you feel yourself starting to hyperventilate
as you watch everyone you know and care for perish. The mask goes back on and
the memory, with its panic, fades. The veil on the mask has somewhat parted now
though. For threads that end, you can see those curated details, but non others.
</p>

<p>
And it dawns on you: This is how she gave you the ability to witness. All of
this was there the whole time, but she's given you the ability to glimpse it.
</p>

<p>
She beckons you to look back upon your own thread. Through following that you
can arrive back in your room, right at the moment this all happened. She helps
you to your feet and she ushers you outside. There is a wan light across the
town of Wentroad. It's dim like moonlight, but red. Its origin is from a red
orb above. Like a moon or sun drawn too large in a picture book for
artistic effect, it occupies a great deal of the sky.
</p>

<p>
A beam of brighter red light comes from a place beyond your horizon. In a way
you cannot describe with words, you know this to be a chain. It holds the red
orb in place. Fixed.
</p>

<p>
You look upon the rest of Wentroad and now that your eyes have adjusted, further
details show you that it is left in ruin. Many parts burned. Bodies litter the
ground. Things of jagged, unreal shapes gnaw at those bodies. They eat not the
meat but the silver threads themselves that terminate at the body. The feasting
creatures are yet more bodies, but threadless entirely. They are the
forever-dead, and without soul.
</p>

<p>
You can feel her emotions - these creatures are abominations to her. She needs
your action in dealing with them.
</p>

<p>
An arm pulls at you. She leads you back inside your room and lays you down where
you were before. She walks out and gently shuts the door. The moment the door
latches, you draw in a deep breath and awake.
</p>

<p>
You clutch to the memory of the dream but you can feel its details fading. But
you are left with realization: The dead bask in the red orb, and the red orb is
held affixed in the sky from a point you do not yet know.
</p>

<p>
These kinds of premonitions are shared at the Circle of Piety but there are
often a lot of details shared. Details that could be damning for you. You don't
think this is the right time to share with them. But maybe an opportunity will
present itself soon. You read up on the coming Sque Valan, knowing it must be
the red orb.

The party entered the Soiled Goat to find Cabby and her guards bound and on
their knees. The glint of crossbow quarrels came from the dark, raised walkways
in the tavern. Other crossbows were aimed at them from across the tavern. It was
impossible to tell which Cabby was the right one.
</p>

<p>
The fight was challenging but overall the party were able to dispatch the
archers. It was only when the shapeshifter revealed themselves that things got
very difficult. The shapeshifter used a blowgun to teleport next to Venn and
hurt him really badly - almost bringing him down in a single set of swings. The
shapeshifter then turned into Venn and they spun in position - making it
difficult to tell the two apart.
</p>

<p>
When Vaux passed what he thought was the right Venn, that Venn attacked and
brought Vaux down. This sent Venn into a rampage. Maia's healing magic was
particularly effective while Vaux was at death's door. The rampage was the one
thing the shapeshifter hadn't counted on. Venn struck back with a terrible
vengeance. The shapeshifter fled by jumping out a window, and almost made it.
But Venn grabbed one of the archers and jumped out and landed on the
shapeshifter, killing them.
</p>

<p>
After the fight, the party showed Cabby the shapeshifter's trophy/planning room.
The party spent some time investigating the ruby encrusted knife there. Other
objects suggested less of utility and more of some memorabilia or objects
representing prior conquests through subterfuge and guile. Cabby mentioned that
the party can have anything from this that they want given her people get to
catalog everything and potentially return possessions to their rightful owners.
She also mentioned that the objects here are highly suggestive that the
shapeshifter had many people under his thumb - threats of killing loved ones or
exposing seemingly damning truths.
</p>

<p>
The knife in particular is thought to be from a Drow priestess of Lolth (Lolth
being the evil deity of spiders and lies). The knife's rubies make a symbolic
hourglass like that of a black widow, and the hilt has etched into it a eight
pointed star with a web motif (which is Lolth's symbol). Commonly these knifes
are used for sacrifices. Drow society is one of a matriarchy - women run the
noble houses and anything resembling a station of office. They are favored by
Lolth and thus are the only ones who can channel her divine power. Males are
very much second class citizens. Every male born beyond the third is given as
sacrifice to Lolth upon birth, and this knife has probably ended several
infants.
</p>

<p>
Drow magical items are known for their potency over ordinary magical items.
However when these items are exposed to sunlight, their magic is permanently
stripped. The only recorded instance of the magic returning is during Valan
Sque - which is a scant 2-3 months away.
</p>

<p>
Two daggers were found on the shapeshifter, and the blow gun and beads used for
teleportation.
</p>

<p>
Cabby said there was a bounty for this she'd promised, which will be awarded
after her, her guards, and the party have all had a chance to rest and calm the
nerves. She asked the party stick around for a couple of days. There is a body
to be returned to the Circle of Piety. The party may wish to speak to Femriel
Moonstaff - the one charged with bringing the body back, to let him know of the
final delay.

<p>
Acting constable Cabby suggests everyone gets some rest.  She knows she needs it
after the harrowing ordeal.  Guards are posted around the inn and its back
passage to ensure the scene isn't tampered with in the meantime.  Despite her
having told you otherwise, she helps substantially with getting Venn over to
wherever you choose to stay for the night.  If it's at an inn, she also tells the
innkeeper that the constabulary will reimburse lodging expenses and meals for
you and yours.
</p>

<p>
Your bodies were full of adrenaline, covered in bruises or worse, and strain of
the last several days.  As a result, even though the day is still early, sleep
comes easy.  The lodgings are modest but it's far better than the encroaching
cold of fall when sleeping under the stars on a bed roll that can't pad away
peddles the size of a-corns.  The sleep itself is very satisfying and restful.
Breakfast is hot and savory.  The coffee isn't even burnt yet.  From glancing
around the lower floor of the inn, you can sense a sort of weight that you
didn't realize was even there.  You are left with a distinct feeling that, in
time, this will go from being a silent prison for many back to being home again.
</p>

<p>
A town guard visits you and delivers a summons from Cabby. She wants to meet
with you at noon to deliver rewards for your work.
</p>

<p>
Femriel Moonstaff, the half-elf acolyte, finds you during your meal as well.
This was acolyte charged with moving the body in the wagon to the Circle of
Piety's headquarters.  He's displeased and shows it all over his body language
and tone, even if his words remain barely-cordial.  When you mention what you've
been up to, he looks surprised for a moment.  He mentions he forgot something
back at the temple and excuses himself.
</p>

<p>
During the period between breakfast and lunch, you're free to restock or acquire
new provisions or address any additional business in town.
</p>

<p>
Cabby looks almost chipper to see you. Her black hair was tangled and almost
matted.  Now it appears to be free and straight once again.  She looks more awake
and alive.  She explains that so many dead-end cases are now being closed
properly.  Loose ends, events and arrangements that just didn't make sense.  The
keystone piece had fallen into place. The trophy room you found provides vast
context to one such as her that has been looking into all of the troubles of
Monrithon for many years.  Cabby gives you 300 gold pieces. She acknowledges it
isn't much for adventurers such as yourselves, but that with Sque Valan coming,
many resources have been allocated ahead of time towards reinforcing defenses
and stocking more provisions.  Monrithon is to become a strong point to weather
out that period.  However she has something even better than coin - not
something posted in the original bounty.  She pulled some strings - strings
easier to pull than she had thought.  The mayor's wife was also under the thrall
of the minders, which only came to light just today.  From that, Cabby was able
to secure a deed to the now-vacant S(p)oiled Goat tavern.  Cabby explains that
the original paperwork showed it was initially zoned as military headquarters,
and as such is built to serve as a makeshift stronghold.  The deed to it is
yours.  She's arranged to have the place cleaned up and some initial
restorations done.  It'll take a couple of weeks but it's how Monrithon can show
its true appreciation.
</p>

<p>
Venn grabs a fist of gold (his fist is pretty big - 50 gold pieces), looks
across the room and simply says "bye", and leaves.
</p>

<p>
What does the party plan to do next? You now have the deed and keys to the
Soiled Goat.  Typically these kinds of rewards go back to the church, but that's
only after "expenses", which usually gets consumed one way or another.  In this
way, clergy have a kind of feast and almost-famine cycle to them, where they can
briefly live extravagantly and then go back to meager compensation.  That said,
you have far more expenses possible than wine, good food, and the best lodgings.
</p>

<p>
I'll also have a revised list of items from Billy the Gray that I'll post
shortly.

<p>
A group of refugees came in from outside. These weren't the normal migratory
peoples coming in from rural areas, seeking shelter for Sque Valan.
</p>

<p>
While they lined up outside of Tasty Tubes and Leaves, one of them tried to
take food out-of-turn. This is when the heroes noticed the green liver spots on
the refugees. The potential food-thief had quite a lot of coverage on their skin
compared to others.
</p>

<p>
The food thief was pushed aside, but once denied food, their spots grew, and
suddenly skin rotted.  What rose was not a creature deprived of food and thus
temporarily robbed of their humanity.  This creature had crossed the threshold
of life into death.
</p>

<p>
The risen creature attacked the person who'd shoved them aside and bit them.
Fortunately Cabby and some guards were on site already having a chat with the
two heroes.  They pulled the zombie aside and tried to deal with them.
</p>

<p>
The eater's condition was magically cured.
</p>

<p>
The heroes quickly realized that certain members of the refugees were in
different stages of development with their liver spots, but each were advancing.
Airy and Armsley were set to task to cooking more food.  There were some
challenges and shoving, but ultimately everyone who wasn't magically cured were
fed.  It was then noticed that the food seemed to postpone the liver-spot
development but was not a cure.  Help was sent for and found.  Supplies from the
tavern were sent for, as well as ale from the Soiled Goat.  Cabby was found to
be among the infected.
</p>

<p>
The healer at the temple responded to the summons and went to work on the
refugees.  The process was slow - taking around 10 minutes per cured person.
Meanwhile the disease (or curse) continued to advance.  Food supplies from the
cart quickly ran out, and food from the tavern was quickly eaten into.  The helpers
had to be careful about who was dispatched and how many, because touch seemed to
spread the disease instantly.  Eventually all that was left was the ale, and
everyone had to drink.  Even the heroes got infected.  The heroes, Cabby, and
remaining refugees had to drink quite a bit.  Small amounts of nasty tasting
rations were choked down (and one time brought back up).  Some folks passed out.
One almost stumbled into the well - a disaster averted with a quick sleep spell.
</p>

<p>
Many would have hangovers, but aside from the initial victim, everyone had
survived and the refugees and helpers alike all cured.

The party learned that the refugees are from a remote town halfway between Lake
Fortune and the Monrithon called Solvost.  Through a witnessing, the party saw a
robed figure with deathly hands provide a child with a coin and asked to toss it
in the well.  The coin carried with it a cursed disease.  Those that drank from
the well soon perished, or otherwise carried the disease long enough to reach
the Monrithon.
</p>

<p>
Cabby gave the heroes a reward for helping the refugees. Food for the food cart
was restocked.
</p>

<p>
The party set out to Solvost. On the final night's camp, they found themselves
being approached from all sides but one. The number of figures and what they are
is unknown.

<p>
The party's camp was attacked for almost all sides. Darkness made it very
difficult to see but with some dancing lights, it was revealed that these were
skeletons and zombies. The party was able to successfully dispatch them, but
lost a horse in the process. Stickers of Weapon Dazzling were used for sources
of light in the fight as well. The party was able to complete their rest.
</p>

<p>
A call was made for Billy the Gray for resupplies of materials components needed
to bring Armsly back. No additional items were purchased, but some folks have
their eyes on some items.

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-16">
<p>
The heroes entered the village of Solvost.  There was a silence that was more
than eerie.  With no commotion, no sound of wildlife or bird song, every sound
seemed agonizingly loud.
</p>

<p>
The party found a dead horse, killed by the disease.  Peasant housing had empty,
unmade beds.  General goods with a relatively short shelf life had spoiled.  The
blacksmith forge had evidence of recent use.  All of the weapon and tool racks
were empty.  Ingots were no where to be found.
</p>

<p>
The well was observed to be desecrated.
</p>

<p>
Upon approaching the well, two ranks of skeletons approached and attacked.  Each
one was accompanied by a spell casting version of some kind that could blast
through its allies (unharmed) and hit multiple victims in a line.
</p>

<p>
The skeletons were quickly dispatched, though one of the spell casting undead
ran away.
</p>

<p>
A heavily armored, undead dragonborn approached the party, claiming they would
make a fine sacrifice as champions.  He claimed to desire to test them further,
and came in for the attack.  His swings leveled buildings, but were very
telegraphed.  His armor and unnatural toughness made him withstand a lot of
punishment.  He was critically wounded, and upon doing so sprouted wings and
left.  The party was unable to finish him off.
</p>

<p>
The well was cleansed with holy water.  The holy water also purified the coin at
the bottom of the well (which was retrieved).
</p>

<p>
The party camped out in the small town shrine.
</p>

<p>
And gained a level! (6)

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-17">
<p>
The party departed Solvost to Lake Fortune.  Not long after they got out of the
town center did they find a blast mark on the road, with bodies next to it.  The
bodies appeared to be zombies that were destroyed, and not the deaths of
peasants.
</p>

<p>
Another was found up a hillside at the beginning of a corn field.  This one had
no bodies.  The party found a sign that said "Closed for the Evening".  It was
dripping a kind of fluidic wood.  Erich went to collect a sample and found the
sign was actually an illusion.  A corn stalk started talking to them.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, back at the carts, Ella started hearing a "Wait what are you doing?
That's too close!" sound that kept repeating itself.  It was later discovered to
be a Minor Illusion spell, set on repeat.
</p>

<p>
When later revisited, the corn stalk was no longer animated.  But a nearby
pumpkin was.
</p>

<p>
The horses' legs turned into large bird legs.  Erich's feet turned into
sandwiches (and well made ones, at that).  Vaux's feathers started turning into
bacon.  Via the pumpkin, the party learned it was Riccard who was causing this,
though not deliberately.  And it was progressively getting worse.  The
belongings in the cart all turned into bananas, and Maia became a giant banana.
</p>

<p>
The party headed back to the corn field, and with the corn stalk's help (it was
back), they made their way through.  In the barn on the other side, hundreds of
doves flew out of the door.  On the inside was a tiny black sphere in the middle
of the barn.  Small bits of hay were getting sucked into it.  They disappeared.
The sphere increased in size every time this happened, but only by a little bit.
</p>

<p>
The party decided to leave that be, and sought out on of the peasant houses for
the farm.  The corn stalk Ella kindly removed and repotted helped them find it.
When they came up to it, the little house sprouted gigantic legs (Babba Yabba
style) and walked off.  What was left behind was a very confused Riccard.
</p>

<p>
Riccard declared he couldn't control his wild magic anymore.  He'd resisted the
poison but lost his ability to restrain the wild magic.  He kept accidentally
cast spellings.  He vomited out brooms that made attacks.  Some of his spells
were cut short by Erich.  Vaux was clever enough to pad an arrow and shoot it at
Riccard in an attempt to disable him.  Ella tried to cure any diseases or
poisons he had, but it didn't work and instead they were teleported on the other
side of the area, where the party learned the sphere had grown into gigantic
amounts, and was still growing.  It was bearing down on them quickly.
</p>

<p>
The final blow to Riccard allowed him to linger enough to say it's best this
way.  He coughed up a perfect pancake, and expired.  The sphere consumed him,
and then shrunk to nothingness.  Erich's feat were restored.  The pumpkin was
back, and mentioned it was going to explode.  It has a sliver of Riccard's
consciousness and implored the party that Riccard had to make that sacrifice or
it would've been devastating.  It also said it needed to explode.  It did, and
covered the entire area with a ridiculous amount of pumpkin guts.  But with it,
the party was now imbued with a new power.
</p>

<p>
Upon returning to the carts, the horses had normal legs and all of the bananas
were now normal things again.
</p>

<p>
The party gained one level in Sorcerer!

<p>
After recovering from their ordeal with Riccard's wild magic, the party set out
once again for Lake Fortune.
</p>

<p>
Maia raised some suspicions about Billy the Gray.  Extra suspiciously, his door
appeared before the party.  Smoke was coming out.  Billy the Gray was having
some trouble.  He was building a basilisk catching magic item in haste and some
part of the construction exploded into magical smoke.  He was trying to get a
basilisk that prematurely hatched and ran to the basement.
</p>

<p>
Billy explained that he'd like to get the basilisk back, cure the last set of
people who he sent to go get them.  He explained he isn't the "capable" type but
since friends-of-the-party had done such a great job before, he figured the
party could handle this task.  He offered 2000gp for the endeavor and the
party haggled up to include a 15% discount on all future goods. He gave the
party a series of remove petrification potions.
</p>

<p>
Billy also threw in that he'd love to know the whereabouts of his pet dragon,
Filbert, who was last seen fleeing to the basement long ago.
</p>

<p>
The party rested up, with some of them trying out Billy's new Billy Bunk - a
magical bed-roll that allows for creates to sleep in an individualized, sensory
deprivation tank kind of space.
</p>

<p>
The party agreed, and descended.
</p>

<p>
Some things the party encountered, in no particular order:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A room with "discount" healing potions and a pair of boxing gloves.  The
boxing gloves animated and attacked the party!  It was dispatched quickly.
The room had a closet on the far side.  A loose stone in the closet wall was
removed, and the party got a glimpse of what the outside of the discount
realm looked like:  rolling hills of gold coins, and gold coins raining from
the sky.  The placed the stone back into its place.</li>
<li>A door was opened and a mound of gold coins spilled out.  There's no visible
end to this gold.  The door is now forced open and cannot be closed without
clearing the gold out.</li>
<li>Another room was found - large, with a span of over 100 feet across.  It was
packed with small spheres, all uniform and varied, solid colors.  They were
the size of grapefruit.  Ella tried going in but quickly sunk - the spheres
were very light and moved out of the way.  No bottom was found.   Ella was
able to get out with the party assisting with a rope.</li>
<li>Another room had a statue in it with old blood caking its knuckles.  On the
far side of the room, A pair of plated gauntlets hung on the wall.  There was
also a door there.  To either side were small cages - about the size adequate
for rats.  When party entered the room, the statue attacked while announcing
"rodents detected, exterminating".</li>
</ol>

<p>
That's where we left off!
</p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-19">
<p>
The party defeated the rodent exterminator.  Ella came across the Hero's Fist -
a set of gauntlets that channels with her abilities.
</p>

<p>
The party also came across the basilisk.  They managed to avoid getting
petrified but the party didn't engage further.  They had bumped into the sales
illusion of the previous occupant.  It seemed to think the basilisk was a
customer.
</p>

<p>
Ella managed to convince the illusion to get the basilisk to close its eyes, but
the illusion couldn't pull it off.  The illusion did offer some "petrification
immunity" potions.  The party went back to the pile of gold forcing the door
open in the other part of the floor.
</p>

<p>
The gold had mostly been cleared out but there was a giant green eye blocking
the door.  It was the eye to a massive gold dragon.  They discovered it was
Filbert!  Filbert had aged some 900 years since then, and referred to Billy the
Gray as his "pet human".
</p>

<p>
Out of the party's request, Filbert created a lasso out of the gold that was
there.
</p>

<p>
The basilisk had gone to the ball pit.
</p>

<p>
The party managed to get it out of the ball pit with some great teamwork.
</p>

<p>
The basilisk was returned to Billy the Gray.  The other group hasn't been found
yet.  The party said they would go find them.  They had recalled that the ball
pit had another doorway attached to it, and they hadn't explored through it yet.

<p>
Erich and Ella spent a little extra time with Billy Gray, mostly to get some
purchases handled.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards they went to follow the trail of Maia and Vaux.  The bright sun and
cloudless sky were harsh on eyes that had been in the more dim discount realm
and Billy's shop.  They found their way to the tavern, the Fuzzy Barnacle.  The
barkeep was cleaning up vomit stains from one of the patrons.  With a quick
cantrip from Erich, the barkeep's job was ended and the grateful barkeep was
quick to help the party.  They learned that the person who'd thrown up was a
dock worker who'd seen something absolutely terrible and tried to drink his way
out of it.  They learned of the errant party members and the constable leaving
more or less together, trying to follow up on the poor lad's issue.
</p>

<p>
While outside, the party noticed a glint in the darkness of the adjoining
forest.  The adjoining forest had a thick canopy and disappeared into darkness.
This made the glint stand out.
</p>

<p>
The pair decided to quickly chase down the glint.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness of the forest, came across the source of the glint.  An odd
break in the canopy shone light on a small mound with a broken suit of armor.
It's wearer had died within it long ago, leaving only an inert skeleton laying
in the armor.  The armor was dirty but showed no signs of rust.  The glint
itself came from the medallion worn about the skeleton's neck.
</p>

<p>
As they approached, an unnatural sense of despair and dread flooded the party.
Ella could sense it, but remained undaunted.  Erich held out well, but had to
make an effort.
</p>

<p>
The party approached with caution and used mage hand to lift the medallion.
Once it left the skeleton, the skeleton crumbled into dust.  Using the mage
hand, the medallion was sent away but the forlorn sense remained.  Erich took a
sample of the bone dust.  Ella grabbed the armor, since normal steel  couldn't
have lasted this long.  They set out to return to the town (Rura).
</p>

<p>
When they approached the town, they noticed the light was different.  There was
a deep overcast.  Getting even closer, even more details resolved.  Parts of the
wharf had rotted away or shattered from larger boats that had been upturned upon
them.  There was no bird song, nor was there any activity of humans or even
smoke coming from buildings.  Casting vision deep out to the opposite side of
the lake, the other two towns also appeared to be completely inactive, and had a
similar color of rot and dullness that the immediate surroundings shared.
</p>

<p>
A raven perched itself upon a storage building that was largely intact.  Other
buildings were collapsed in various levels of severity, but all obvious.  Erich
tried to interact with it, but got no reply or useful gestures.  Ella spotted a
large black feather sitting near the front area of the storage building - too
large to belong to the raven.  Ella knew this was related to Vaux.
</p>

<p>
They had come to understand that the barrier had become thin between the planes
of the material plane (our typical plane) and the Shadowfell.  The Shadowfell
being a dark reflection of the material plane.  They reasoned that they'd
stepped into the realm inadvertently.  The draining feelings of despair
made more sense.
</p>

<p>
They opened the door to the storage building, and the entire first floor was
packed to the ceiling with the upper half of skulls (no jaws).  The skulls
poured out, and many fell from the wharf where the entrance was to the lake.
Every single skull was facing the party as they slowly, unevenly bobbed deeper
into the lake.
</p>

<p>
When the skulls fell out, they left a vacated area.  To the left they could make
out some stairs and could understand that the upstairs was not similarly clogged
with skulls.  They pulled some more skulls out, and headed up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
Upstairs, the party found the entire upper area to be a carnal house.  Some
human-like beings had been gruesomely slaughtered to the point of being neigh
unrecognizable.  Inside was also an impressively long skeleton, with
thigh-length claws on its hands, and a slight impression of rotted and torn
robes on its body.  The still body of Vaux was visible at the creature's feet.
</p>

<p>
Battle with the large skeleton was immediately joined, and the party found that
this creature could teleport between the shadows.  They managed to choke out the
shadows from it, and destroy the creature.  It fell into a pile of bones and it
slowly started to crumble to dust (very slowly - just a little piece at a time).
During the fight, Vaux was stabilized but did not come to consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Remembering back, this creature matches the description of a bone claw - a
failed lich.  Something went wrong during the transformation and the bone claw
is what remained.  More or less completely robbed of its own sense of self, all
that is left is the primal evil that drove the creature to seek immortality
through undeath.
</p>

<p>
Blood was dripping to the lower floor.  They did find some odd footprints
heading upstairs, but seemed to fade in a way that bloody prints shouldn't.
They faded as if they weren't there anymore, instead of a stain that became less
and less of an imprint on each step.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-22">
<p>
The party noticed outside of the storage building that a boat house seemed to be
radiating that same sense of dread and despair.  This boat house was at the very
end of the wharf.  They decided to head back to drop off Vaux in a safe place to
recover.
</p>

<p>
Nothing could be heard at the distance from the boathouse - dead inside.
</p>

<p>
While trying to head back to the tavern, they encountered guards who were
confused about the party, and didn't let them pass since they were under orders.
The party had a hard time convincing them about Vaux, who they had seen before.
Eventually the constable showed up and straightened things out - they were
allowed to pass but the constable stayed with them.
</p>

<p>
The party took Vaux back to the tavern.  Being a tavern they couldn't house the
kenku but recommended an inn for it - the Rocking Chair.  Vaux was left there to
recover.
</p>

<p>
They party traveled back to the boat house.  The constable followed them but
stopped as they got closer to the boat house.  They tried listening, but a large
pointy bone came through the door, almost hitting them.  Ella kicked in the door
and they saw the bone claw there.  Additionally, several zombies attacked from
the boat itself as well as from the inner wharf in the boat house.  The bone
claw was what had skewered the door - from the pattern of the rotted robes, it
was the same one as before - somehow renewed.
</p>

<p>
The party was victorious, but afterwards the dragonborn death knight came out of
the boat.

<p>
Maia fell during the last leg of the fight.  Ella and Erich were able to defeat
the remaining undead, but were spent in the process.  Ella stabilized and healed
Maia, and gathered up both Maia and the body of the fallen death knight.
</p>

<p>
The two made their way back to the wagons.  The docks seemed empty, deserted.  A
quick check showed they don't think they are in the Shadowfell any longer.  They
went to deposit Maia in the jail cell next to Vaux.  The jail was unguarded and
the door left open.  During the trip, they noticed the town seemed deserted,
like everything just suddenly stopped.
</p>

<p>
Sensing something amiss, they gathered up Vaux into the wagon and sought a local
temple in hopes of utilizing their Circle connections.  They found a temple of
Pelor, but as they got close to it, the aura of despair they have become
familiar with washed over them.  They were spent, and had nothing with which to
engage.  Sneaking around revealed there was someone in there, but they couldn't
tell anything about them.  They went in anyways, cautiously.
</p>

<p>
Inside was a typical temple, with pews in rows facing a central podium at the
end of the room.  The pews were packed with people, all facing forward.  A woman
stood at the podium.  She exhibited a typical beauty, with brown hair.  She
seemed paler than she should be.  Her dress was black with a coquettish cut.
</p>

<p>
She said was drained from having turned an entire town.  She also noted her
perished death knight.  She repeatedly asked for the champion.  Once identified
as Maia, she kept repeating that phrase.  She mentioned her master was aligned
against the Raven Queen.  She sat in his rightful thrown.  She wouldn't divulge
the name of her master, stating he is the king of death, and she wouldn't have
his name sullied by their tongues.  She stated that words have great power, and
she would retain the power of his name.
</p>

<p>
After some exchange, she came to the realization that the party wasn't there in
force, and perhaps were also spent.  Once that happened, she gestured, and the
heads in the pews all turned in unison towards the party.  Their torsos did not
turn, nor did they shift in place - the necks turned inhumanly backwards.  Faint
red glows came from the eyes.  The party started to get out.  Once outside, they
noticed more people standing in doorways of nearby buildings, staring at them
with the same faint red glows.  The people started to approach them.
</p>

<p>
Ella used her divine sense and was able to tell that undead were nearby but also
that the temple was desecrated.  She barred the door using the death knight's
mace.  Erich used his mage hand to start torching parts of the temple.  This
cost them some precious time, and the people made swipes at them.  The party was
able to get back to their carts and gallop away.  As they departed the village,
they noticed many dozens of people lined up outside, staring at the them with
that same, faint red glow.
</p>

<p>
They traveled at a normal pace back to Wentroad until night.  With just two of
them, setting up watch was difficult.  Ella stayed up and allowed Erich the
rest, and they quickly got back on the road.  As they set out, Erich noticed a
single person at the edge of their vision back the way they came from.  The next
night, Erich took watch and Ella rested.  Armsly was sent to scout using its
darkvision, and Erich saw through Armsly's eyes.  Armsly came across many people
standing in the darkness.  No color could be seen, but that faint eye glow was
present.  Everything went dark.  When Erich's vision returned, he realized that
a good 8 hours of not moving versus a body of people moving without stopping at
all, even if slower, would easily overtake such a group.  They were likely
completely encircled.

In a fugue state, Maia is greeted by the Raven Queen.  Maia can see the party

Maia and Vaux.  She hands Maia the strand to Vaux.  She keeps the one to Maia.

The party fights.  They kill the necromancer, and the undead collapse.  Maia
erects a Tiny Hut and the party rests.  The party identifies the wands of the
necromancer - a wand of spell storing, and a wand of magic missile.  There is
also a coin.  It contains an entity that offers any sort of services - like a
genie.  It exacts a price though.  The price is based on the nature of the ask,
and would need to be negotiated in that moment.  The party is split on whether
or not to use its power.

The party started the day with a celebratory breakfast directly from the Tasty
Tubes and Leaves.  However it didn't really break the morning fast - the party
was still hungry.  An entire second helping was made and devoured quickly, but
still the hunger stayed.  Their bellies were full though.  Upon doing some
detection, they found the land had a faint hint of desecration to it, but they
couldn't determine what exactly.
</p>

<p>
The party continued south.  They found a wagon crashed just off the road.  It
had a lot of blood and some gristle - active signs of a struggle but something
very quick.  The wagon's front wheel was shattered and caved in as if it
received a mighty blow.  The tracks were something between humanoid and beast.
There were also paw prints.  The prints were many.  Inside the wagon they found
food barrels and crates - all forced open and emptied.  One of the crates had a
false bottom which was exposed when the wall of it was pried off.  A vast
quantity of gems were found under this false bottom.  They happened upon a note
or log of sorts.  The gems were bound for a Draig Evergrin.  Evergrin is a
fairly common last name given to half elves either orphaned or of otherwise
unknown surnames.  The name Draig Evergrin has been in local news as a sort of
thief in the shadows.  The note spoke of giving a golden sextant to a guard in
Monrithon.  There are various other exchanges - most above board such as
tariffs, lodging and food expenses and so forth.  It's puzzling as to why
someone would keep notes of their illegal activities, but the note was only
found after a thorough search.
</p>

<p>
They continued south again.  It wasn't long before they came across the sound of
yipping and howling.  Using an arcane eye, they found gnolls attacking an
outpost past the hill ahead.  The party cleared the hill and found many gnolls
attacking the Nomasgard watch members of the outpost.  Two were left, and one
died rather immediately.  The party engaged, and the fight was difficult.  The
gnolls were savage and cunning.  They focused on the physically weak members of
the group and one particularly powerful one displayed aptitude for attacking
spell casters.  The party managed to pull through and defeat the gnolls, as well
as save the last surviving member of the outpost, Murk Dungees.

Five weeks remain until Sque Valan.
</p>

<p>
After the fight with the gnolls, the party continued south to Wentroad.  Along
the road, there were tracks of gnoll and humanoid movement.  Instead of
following the road, they crossing the road to the river, and then headed back
into the plains again.  Paw prints were included, but not identified.  The
tracks didn't indicate signs of struggle by the humanoids - in fact the running
seemed fervorous.  Nothing along the river at that point seemed out of place.
Small boats are known to take the Went River to Stics or be towed back to
Wentroad.  None were seen, and the reason for that not entirely obvious.  Though
seeing nobody headed to the now cursed Lake Fortune gave some relief.
</p>

<p>
The day ended, and there was an estimated day of travel left to reach Wentroad.
The night was difficult.  The tiny hut spell offered immense safety and
protection for the party, but it was deemed unwise to cram the horses in and
risk trampling.  Howling and yipping could be heard from multiple directions on
the first watch.  It came from the south, the north east, and the west (past
Went River).  It was notable, but the distance was deemed too great or even for
the closer instance - across the river.  So no alerts were raised, but the
information was passed on.  During the last watch, it was said that the
sounds surrounded the camp although they remained distant.  Some thought they
were too close.  By the time Vaux's shift came up, the horses were visibly
spooked and lightly testing the strength of their tie downs.  A rustle was heard
in the bushes not too far away.  Maia was woken and he used his gifts to help
himself and Vaux perceive deep into the night.  They found a single wolf.  Maia
threw a fire bolt at the wolf - almost grazing it but managing to head upwards
as to not light the dry grass.  The wolf yelped and ran.  Silence followed.
Then the howling and yipping came back from many directions all at once.  The
party decided to break camp at that point.
</p>

<p>
Maia used Sending to ask for aid from Archminster Veddik Joylith.  While
surprised, Joylith agreed.
</p>

<p>
Vaux found some blueberries but had accidentally gobbled them all before
returning to the party.  While silent and offering no explanation, the purple
smear around the line of the beak told everything.
</p>

<p>
After some time, the hunger abated.  Breakfast was lost due to being
over stuffed, but the lunch that followed hit the spot.
</p>

<p>
With Wentroad in sight, they could see the road leading to them had nobody on
it.  Though it showed activity through the smoke plumes common among cities.
The lack of Circle escort set the party on edge and they wanted to proceed with
stealth, but needed to get closer as to not waste magical energies.
</p>

<p>
Upon getting closer, the party could see the city's smoke plumes were growing,
and they were clearly black at this distance - things not meant to be burned
were burning.  They hastened their approach.  Getting more closer, they could
tell the stone ramparts were knocked down in some places.  Closer still, and
they could see some shapes (presumably people) in drab colors far in the
distance, taking the west-bound road.  Black and dark brown shapes with metallic
glints upon them followed.  Eventually the latter shapes caught up with the
former, and all that remained were the black and dark brown shapes with the
metallic glints.
</p>

<p>
Closer still - it became apparent the walls were knocked down in places with
large bits of stone wall strewn about.  Bodies of gnolls and humans lay
scattered near the stores.  More things were burning now.
</p>

<p>
Approach was made to the wall, and a closer inspection was made.  The bodies
looked like typical descriptions of cultists - people who were in rags or soiled
clothing that awkwardly revealed parts of the body.  They had crude animal masks
made from parts of animals - sometimes a cut head or skin, and sometimes that of
bone.  They wielded bones sharpened and rope-tied as makeshift daggers.  They
carried farming implements and rusty weapons.  The gnolls were better equipped
and were actually armored.  The humans tended to be killed via burning,
bludgeoning, or both.  The many gnolls were filled with arrows, but also some
were killed via burning or bludgeoning sources.  With proximity to the far-flung
stone from the now-collapsed sections of wall, it seemed as if parts of the
explosion had claimed them.  They noticed nobody was on the ramparts, save
fallen members of the town guard.
</p>

<p>
Maia made himself invisible and snuck in first.  Gnolls could be seen darting
across the streets, sometimes followed by hyenas.
</p>

<p>
The bagel bakery was not far away.  Maia and Vaux set out together for it.  By
the time they arrived at the bakery, the sky was black with smoke.  A gentle
rain of ash was everywhere.  The only discernible color was red anywhere anyone
looked.
</p>

<p>
They snuck up to the bakery and saw bits of on-fire paper flying out from one
side - the side where the stairs led up to Maia's office.  Another nearby
building was ablaze.  As they approached, the baker was thrown out of window and
landed - his wounds appearing obviously mortal.  A gnoll stood triumphant over
his body.  Maia put that gnoll to sleep and it even included another one he
couldn't see in the bakery.  There was hope the rest of the family was spared -
there was a cellar that maybe they got to.  As they went in, Maia caught a
glimpse of a red face peering out from the same wall his office entry shared.
The face had a long nose and long, pointed ears.  Was it grinning?  When
spotted, it snapped back.
</p>

<p>
The bakery had a woman and child - the baker family all accounted for - slain.
They just didn't make it to the cellar in time.
</p>

<p>
Vaux went to find the red faced creature, but it was no where to be found.

<p>
It's strangely cold in the burning city.  The sky is completely blackened with
sooty overcast.  There's a gentle snow of ash.  Everything is a tint of deep
red.  There is no sun to be seen.
</p>

<p>
The party decided to head out to the keep, the physical building of central
governance in Went Road.  They wind up picking up villagers, members of the town
guard, and even members of the local army.  Then they circle back to the citadel
of the Circle of Piety, having realized that there's probably some answers
there.  People seem to pay a silent respect to Clyge Ironsworth as the party
takes them in.
</p>

<p>
All the while the party learns from Clyge that the head of the Circle of Piety
left through an escape tunnel that leaves walls of Went Road.  They abandoned
upon getting the message from Maia.  Clyge had been the one to escort them to
the tunnel, but didn't completely realize at the time what they were doing, and
has sworn to right this.  He also shares that the Circle had been following
some cult activity involving the undead in the area.  The body he was bringing
back when the party first met Clyge was that of a spy who had infiltrated one of
the cults.
</p>

<p>
Just as the party is about to enter the citadel's grounds, a group of refugees
escorted by a small amount of the town guard and local army arrives.  There's a
lot of refugees.  The party decides to send them through the escape tunnel.  One
of Clyge's squires is sent since they know the way too.
</p>

<p>
Just as that starts, a gnoll spots all of this and blows its horn.  Soon there
is howling and yipping that can be heard.
</p>

<p>
The party readies for a fight.  Clyge instructs the group to stand to his side
or behind him.  The gnolls begin to approach in force.  Among them are six
gnolls covered in fetishes and have drums whose skins look to be humanoid faces
stretched upon the drum heads, with cavities such as eyes and mouths crudely
sewn shut.  They beat upon these drums, and it is a discordant sound that no
natural instrument should make.  They form a circle.  In the middle of these
gnolls is a larger one, covered in gore and carrying a menacing flail.
</p>

<p>
Clyge draws his sword - a blade of glass shard.  He points it to the sky.  A
pillar of sunlight pierces the clouds and hits the glass blade.  Brilliant white
light bounces and hits everyone standing to Clyge's side or behind him.  The
color is restored to these individuals and their equipment, the ash is cleaned
from their bodies and clothing.  The party feels like a bow pulled completely
taught - right at the limit and no further.  This is a stronger intensity than
any adrenaline rush they have ever encountered.
</p>

<p>
The party manages to wound a couple of the gnolls.
</p>

<p>
As if in response to this gesture, the six drum-gnolls do a single beat
together.  The large gnoll in the middle of them violently writhes and seems to
stretch and grow.  For a second, it stops and nothing seems to happen.  Then the
gnoll explodes in a rain of bone, sinew, and other vital components.  The six
gnolls fall over.  From the heart of the explosion emerges a new gnoll, far
larger than the last.  Its brigandine armor is made not of small platelets but
of breast plates and other large pieces of humanoid armor - all of which appear
as platelets against its hide.  A three headed flail is the only weapon this
creature carries.  It howls in rage, and instantly smashes one of the wounded
gnolls next to it, resulting in immediate death.  The gnolls take that as their
signal and charge the party.
</p>

<p>
Several times the front line was smashed back by the colossal gnoll.  Each time
they got back up and reinforced the line.  Magic missiles, moonbeams, and more
smashed into the giant gnoll.  Ella cut a swathe into it so hard that radiant
energy persisted where the stroke was made - a crescent of brilliant light.
</p>

<p>
The gnoll was eventually felled.  In its death rattle it took another gnoll with
it.  Its body and possessions burned away in sulfuric smoke.
</p>

<p>
The party was extremely exhausted afterwards.  They searched the citadel for
answers.  They were able to learn that the Circle knew about the gnoll activity,
but didn't fully grasp the relation of the gnolls and the undead until Maia had
sent his message.  That is when the leadership decided it was time to leave.
</p>

<p>
The party setup a tiny hut in the tunnel, which blocked its passage.  There they
rested.
</p>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-dirshum--campaigns--wand-of-woe--recaps--session-30">
<p>
The party awoke from an uneventful rest.  Nobody stayed on watch so they could
rest up.  When they prepared to depart, they noticed a cloaked figured with a
large, uncomfortable looking backpack who was sitting and propped up against the
Tiny Hut on the side leading back to the Circle of Piety's citadel.  The
figure's back was to them, and so it was hard to make out anything identifying
about them.  The party asked them to identify themselves, but there was no
reply.  Just as they were about to take action, the hut collapsed and the figure
fell over, incredibly startled.
</p>

<p>
The figure was a tiefling who immediately identified herself as Turnigal.  She
was short for a tiefling, with typical red skin and cinderous looking eyes that
hid behind glasses.  Her wooden backpack was overstuffed with scrolls and books.
She worked for the Circle as a record keeper.  She proved immediately insightful
to some of the odd goings-on with deeper theories of planar influence.
</p>

<p>
Maia made himself invisible and peeked outside the citadel.  Monrithon was
ablaze.  No more sounds of battle were heard.  The red tint and smoke still made
visibility mostly impossible.  It was frigid out.  Maia returned.
</p>

<p>
The party set out to go further down the escape tunnel, with the tiefling in
tow.
</p>

<p>
At some point the party thought about interrogate the gnoll they had captured.
It seemed deferential to them, even going so far as to expose its throat to
them.  The party killed it though, and left its body behind.
</p>

<p>
The tunnel seemed to go on forever.  They walked for hours.  Vaux left some of
her weapon's stickers behind to mark if they were going it circles, if that was
even possible (the tunnel was just a straight passage).  Hours more went by.
Something was wrong.  When the party started inspecting their surroundings
closer, they noticed the area behind them disappeared into darkness that not
even dark vision could penetrate.  Ella approached this wall of darkness.  As
she did, she started hearing a howling wind (or maybe it was something else, but
it was a persistent sound).  As she inched closer, the sound got rapidly louder
to her, to the point of drowning out someone speaking to her while right next to
her.  She could feel a wind at her picking up as well.  She put her arm closer
and felt intense wind against it.
</p>

<p>
The party thought better of exploring this more.  When they turned to look at
the path forward again, the tunnel was no longer just extending forward forever,
but now split into two directions opposite to each other.  Each had a
portcullis over it its entry.  The party decided to go left.
</p>

<p>
Ella and Clyge went through first and found the portcullis suddenly slide down a
few inches after they passed it.  Clyge and Ella tried holding the portcullis
open and the remaining party rushed through.  They couldn't really stop it, but
thankfully it never dropped low enough to endanger anyone.
</p>

<p>
In room they entered they found a doorway leading elsewhere, as well as a
bookshelf and a table with fancy dinnerware.
</p>

<p>
The bookshelf seemed to be log books from a fire brigade.  The dates were odd
though - they seemed to be dated 2500 years in the future!  Perusing through the
logs, it was found that many of the fire brigade's efforts were put towards
misused or faulty magic items.   Magic items are extremely rare, almost to the
point where the public believes them mythical.  It's most peculiar for fire
brigade logs suggest magic items are so prevalent that it takes a significant
amount of their efforts, and even is written in a tone as if such things are
commonplace.  The party grabbed several books for later reading.  Turnigal was
put to the task of seeing if the language had changed much in that time that
might indicate the authenticity of these logs or any other things they could
find.
</p>

<p>
The dinnerware mysteriously disappeared before inspection could be done, but
there was memory of it being studded with jewels and being made to exquisite
quality.  Vaux whistled a tune.
</p>

<p>
The party went into the next room.  The room was mostly empty with a single
doorway on the other side.  Upon entering the room, something smothered out the
party's torches.  The room went dark for only a moment before Maia cast light
into it again.  There was a living mold attacking them, and two humanoid fungal
creatures.  These creatures immediately began attacking.  When the creatures
struck or were hit themselves, spores would go flying into the air and it was
hard not to breathe in.  The feeling was head-splitting aches but accompanied by
sharp visions or memories.
</p>

<p>
The memories included:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A large blue tent, with goblinoids on the offensive.  A mammoth charges
through tent and goblin alike.</li>
<li>Gorgons laying on their sides in a cave.  Their bellies distended.  The
bellies exploded and out emerged gnolls with murder in their eyes.  They
attacked.</li>
<li>A wagon tipped over with a poorly spelled "Not Goblin ambush" written on it.
There's some blood in the wagon, and a tuft of cotton stuck to a nail.  It
makes one think of a stuffed animal.</li>
<li>Walking through a forest whose canopy is so dense that a sunny day makes for
darkness deeper than most indoor places.  Pine needs cover the ground.  There
are what appear to be ancient ruins - brick work with age and no longer
complete (though what they could have formed looks haphazard at best).
Behind one of the walls you see a purple topped mushroom right next to you.
It shakes and squeals.  Fungal creatures sharing the same purple rise up from
the ground and attack.</li>
<li>A wizard hastily scribbles against the grass of rolling hills with magic
chalk, leaving inscriptions behind in a circular pattern.  A dome of magical
force surrounds you.  Outside is a massive blue dragon, tracing a claw along
its surface and trying to make banter with you.  In the distance you can see
a white and green dragon finishing a silver dragon.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Most of these seemed random and different, except for the wagon with the tuft of
cotton.
</p>

<p>
Turnigal participated in the fight with little bolts of fire that the fungal
creatures seemed vulnerable to.  The mold fled, and the fungal creatures
perished.
</p>

<p>
It was asked how Turnigal could do that but she said that tieflings don't like
to talk about it.  It was suggested that the in the next room Turnigal should do
some blasting and Ella would protect her.  Turnigal felt very scared by this and
started to cry.  Ella felt pretty bad and said she wouldn't be expected to do
anything, which made Turnigal feel a lot better.
</p>

<p>
A tiny hut was made and the party rested once again.
