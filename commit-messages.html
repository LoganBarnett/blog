Writing good commit messages may not be totally essential to the software
development process but it is essential to one&rsquo;s own sanity. &ldquo;Self-documenting&rdquo;
code only explains the <b>what</b>, not the <b>why</b>. Even then, what should go into a
commit message?

must include a &ldquo;title&rdquo;. Commit messages can include bodies, but the bodies are
optional.

Anytime you do <code>git commit -m 'add stuffs'</code>, you are simply populating the
commit title (<code>add stuffs</code>) and the body is left empty. These are good for
quick-and-dirty commits, but it&rsquo;s hard to put much useful information in there.
For the record: I still make commits like these. Generally I do them as quick
commits to save my work for the day or perhaps for trivial alterations on
repositories where no real tracking is done.

Sometimes there really just isn&rsquo;t a lot of meaningfulness to add to a commit.
For example, <a href="https://github.com/LoganBarnett/dotfiles">https://github.com/LoganBarnett/dotfiles</a> is my dotfiles repo, and
many of the commits are like this one: <a href="https://github.com/LoganBarnett/dotfiles/commit/121f854023fb070d51cb6705ddff69f3574fbd8f">121f85</a>.

It&rsquo;s a rite of passage to undergo the terrible feeling of having to commit to
observe your changes. Some nastiness in the build/CI system only seems to
manifest there, and the only way that system runs or picks up changes is by
detecting new commits, or can only see committed code. An idealist would tell
you that you should do everything you can to run locally. They aren&rsquo;t wrong.
Sometimes this means you would need to stand up your own Jenkins system locally,
and configure it just like the operations team did in their hosted environment,
except yours needs to run locally. Other times you&rsquo;re using something like
GitHub Actions, and there&rsquo;s recourse here. GitHub Enterprise exists for people
with high values of <code>$MONEY</code> and if you&rsquo;re working as a simple software engineer
you might get paid well, but not enough for this.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s some examples of people obviously flailing that I&rsquo;ve observed over the
years, self included:

<p>
When you get into this kind of loop, it is healthy to question whether it really
is necessary. Change, commit, push, watch results is a very slow way to go about
your work. Sometimes it&rsquo;s the most reasonable thing to do, but it&rsquo;s healthy to
stop and ask if it really is. This also pollutes the commit history. Is it
really harmful? No, not in a direct sense. But when folks go spelunking through
the history later in desperate search of context, this will be what they have to
filter through.

<p>
Commits are there to give context to changes in a historical sense. They should
tell the reader <b>why</b> the change is being made. The code itself shows you a bit
of the <b>what</b> and the <b>how</b>, but doesn&rsquo;t record how you got there exactly. That
can be really helpful when debugging later. Remember: One of your debugging
tools is to simply remove code or roll back changes until you see a change in
behavior.

provide overrides for JQL to sync tickets

This provides the ability to override the JQL used in ejira-update-jql.
From #20 there is a need to synchronize only the user's involved
tickets.

The original behavior should be unchanged. @osktyn has generously
provided a JQL statement to use. This is provided as
`ejira-jql-my-unresolved-fn`, which can be set via the variable
`ejira-update-jql-unresolved-fn`. An additional
`ejira-update-jql-resolved-fn` is also provided but doesn't need to be
overridden for the purposes of #20 - it just seemed appropriate given
this change.

Any stylistic changes are unintentional. Please nitpick away :)

<p>
Let&rsquo;s break down what went into this.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--destined-for-reviewers">
<p>
This is all gearing up to eventually land in a pull request description. In
fact, pull requests will populate the title and description using your commits!
There&rsquo;s so much informational overlap between the two, we might as well just
toss it into the commit and allow the review system (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket,
etc) to handle the rest.
</p>

<p>
In that way, you&rsquo;ll see that your audience is both a reviewer who will allow the
change to go in, and a future generation of engineers (which could include you,
once you forget everything you did - and you absolutely will). The information
the two audiences need is virtually the same. Reviewers need to understand how
it works and why it&rsquo;s happening so they can allow the changes in. Debuggers need
context for why the changes were made in the first place, and what was attempted
to be solved in doing so.

<div id="outline-container-different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--commit-title" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--commit-title"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.2.</span> Commit Title</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--commit-title">
<p>
First, I have the succinct title:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org01cbb89">
provide overrides for JQL to sync tickets
</pre>

<p>
I like to keep my commits in the present, imperative tense. This isn&rsquo;t strictly
needed, but tends to help keep the message short and succinct. Consider &ldquo;adds
foo behavior&rdquo; over &ldquo;will add foo behavior&rdquo; or &ldquo;added foo behavior&rdquo;. It might not
seem like much, but it adds up quickly. You want to keep your title around 72
characters or so. I think this trend started from the Linux kernel documentation
which has:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For these reasons, the &ldquo;summary&rdquo; must be no more than 70-75
characters, and it must describe both what the patch changes, as well
as why the patch might be necessary.  It is challenging to be both
succinct and descriptive, but that is what a well-written summary
should do.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I reject the &ldquo;why&rdquo; listed in this. Save that for the body. When I&rsquo;m looking at
big lists of commits, I need you to tell me what changed, and I&rsquo;ll dig into the
why if I&rsquo;m curious.
</p>

<p>
You&rsquo;ll also note that the title isn&rsquo;t fully capitalized/punctuated. This is for
brevity, and the fact that it&rsquo;s restricted one line helps with any possible
misinterpretation.

</div>

<div id="outline-container-different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--a-blank-line" class="outline-4">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-different-kinds-of-commits--healthy-commits--a-blank-line">
<p>
Yup. Git demands you have a blank line between the title and what comes next:
the body.
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orga864036">

This adds a foo because we really need one more foo.

Fortunately editors will typically colorize the line in some nasty red color if
you happen to forget this.

My rough structure is as follows:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Mentions the ticket number that prompted this work and how this change relates
to it.</li>
<li>Add additional context for the reviewer and explains how the changes come
together.</li>
<li>Lets the reviewer know I&rsquo;m a foreigner to the project and am happy to
accommodate formatting changes. Largely this is optional, but polite since
this change is against an open source project where we are all strangers to
each other.</li>
<li>Some thanks - I do this at the end of my first communications for most open
source projects. Open source burn out is real, and just giving some thanks
can help reduce. It also helps correct any misinterpreted tone that was lost
in reading my earlier text.</li>

<p>
Whether you&rsquo;re using something connected to Jira, GitHub itself, or some other
review system, you can link to an issue or ticket (same thing) in the system
using a specially formatted identifier (part of the ticket&rsquo;s number itself).
</p>

<p>
In later days, I started using this format:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd390dfd">
Address SE-12345 - File paths with spaces cause the deployment to fail.
</pre>

<p>
This includes the ticket number (<code>SE-12345</code>), what this change does in regards
to that ticket (&ldquo;addresses&rdquo; the ticket), and a quick summary of what that ticket
is about (file paths with spaces cause the deployment to fail). This saves the
reader from having to dig into the ticket unless they want to. The review system
will automatically link to that ticket, so it&rsquo;s handy. But also, organizations
shift in tech stack over time. This particular commit mentions a Jira formatted
number, but what if Jira is down? What if this commit is being looked at some
five years later when the organization decided to do away with Jira? At the very
least, we have some minimal context that will outlive such systems.
</p>

<p>
Including the ticket number is also required for SOC2 compliance, or at least as
it manifests from security gurus at large. All work must be tracked back to a
work item (ticket, issue, etc).

This is more free-form prose where you have your chance to explain an approach
you made, or why you decided <b>not</b> to pursue more obvious solutions. Sometimes
this will be minimal. You&rsquo;re adding yet another button, and more buttons will be
coming. Generally though, your changes will be coming in as &ldquo;unit&rdquo; of work. So
it&rsquo;s not just an added button, but the functionality that comes with it. You
could explain what the new feature does in a short summary. For example: &ldquo;This
new UI allows users to add their favorite pets to their posts. This is tagged in
the database and a webhook has been added so third party applications can notify
pets of these mentions.&rdquo; This kind of message speaks so much more than just a
bunch of changes in a file.

It&rsquo;s legitimate to throw in some extra things. For example:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I&rsquo;m not familiar to this code base, so please let me know if there&rsquo;s anything
I can do to better contribute.</li>
<li>I tested against servers X and Y because I could not reproduce this locally.</li>
<li>On a fresh clone I was unable to get the tests running locally, but they seem
unrelated to my changes and no additional tests failed as part of these
changes.</li>
<li>This should not be merged until (link) is also complete.</li>
<li>This is the third time we&rsquo;ve fixed this problem this week. Perhaps after this
is resolved we can look into the issue together?</li>

Generally you&rsquo;ll be working off a feature branch of some kind. Make all of the
small, less verbose commits all you like. Once you get done though, you should
squash your commits into the smallest number as is reasonable. These squashed
commits can then include your verbose form of documentation.

Rebasing is a topic unto itself. I&rsquo;ve met some folks getting closer to
retirement who are vehemently against rebasing. To them I say: How are they
going to know? I can rebase my private branches all day, or take a branch with
my daily commits and create a new branch with the rebased commit(s). By the time
it reaches a pull request, no one is the wiser.

This is a lot to type! But it&rsquo;s better to have this. <code>git blame</code> becomes your

Calvinball and oftentimes are done under tremendous pressure (production is
down). Any clues you can give yourself or others will be greatly appreciated
later.

<p>
It can be hard to keep this up, or to push yourself to write that little extra

Okay the sentence ends a little weirdly. We don&rsquo;t want to be grammar police but
at the same time at least we understand the intent better here. We&rsquo;re not left
guessing.

This advice is more for foreign repositories than one you are familiar with.

<p>
How many columns to wrap to, and whether or not you should wrap at all is
something that folks go to nerd war over. I&rsquo;ve not been at a workplace where
there was total agreement here. One side wins, and the other shrugs and has to
make due.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re on the 80 column side, congrats! Your side won when it comes to commit
bodies. Part of the reason you want this is because when you run <code>git log</code> from
the command line, that log message eating up the full width of your monitor is
going to be difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
Generally you&rsquo;re going to find your text editor already aligns with this for
commit messages, and so there&rsquo;s nothing to really do here.

<p>
Oftentimes repositories have a <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file (extension can vary or be
nonexistent). This file will outline what is expected of you to contribute
changes of any kind. This includes how to author commits, pull requests, etc. It
can vary quite a bit between projects, so make sure to check it. Some of the
things they ask may be in direct counter to what I&rsquo;ve mentioned above. In those
cases, I recommend you acquiesce to their demands. Nobody is compelled to accept
your changes, and anything you can do to play by their rules will make it easier
to have your changes accepted.
</p>

<p>
Oftentimes, I find these oppressive. I see a lot of projects adopting
<a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">Conventional Commits</a> or something similar. I love me some CI, but I hate me some
Semantic Versioning. Conventional Commits takes a bit to read through, and it is
very rigid about what goes into the commit and how to do it.

<p>
What I dislike about Conventional Commits primarily is that it gets wrapped up
in taxonomy of tickets. Is this a bug? Is it a feature? What should I use if my
feature cleverly fixes a bug? Will this change break something?
</p>

<p>
Your intention will never have any impact over behavior. Claim &ldquo;this shouldn&rsquo;t
break anything&rdquo;, and you almost invite disaster. Seriously - go ask your
favorite QA member about this. They&rsquo;ll laugh at you.  They laughed at me :(
Virtually any change is a change in behavior, and changes in behavior break
<b>something</b>.

My favorite patch version break was with Node v10 (I&rsquo;ll find the exact
version later). This patch version has 80 commits behind it, and made an
&ldquo;innocent&rdquo; change which subtly broke the networking stack. My only recourse was
to lock the Node version to an exact version until we could clear investigation
time from the org (spoiler: it never really got fixed).
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve contributed to work projects where ticket numbers had to be in the title.
I&rsquo;m not sure how I feel about this. On one hand, you can glance through tickets
quickly (though <code>git log | grep -C12 &lt;ticket-number&gt;</code> will do that too). On the
other hand, it eats away at previous space for communicating your changes in
summarized form.
</p>

<p>
As weird as these might be, it&rsquo;s best to follow them. Over time, the ceremony
will melt away into habit and you&rsquo;ll barely notice it. It&rsquo;s something to

contributers to jump through in order to correct a typo? The more requirements
your <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> document outlines, the fewer contributions you can expect.
