# Job experience

## NWEA (2016-current)

  * Built a React-Redux user interface for proctoring (running) student tests.
    The UI used algebraic data types with Flow.
    * Mocks were kept in sync with the Swagger definitions, and all data was
      santized at virtually no cost. The UI oftentimes was the insurance that
      APIs stayed true to their contract.
    * Achieved 100% type coverage, and 350+ acceptance test scenarios.
    * Feature flag system allowed features to be overridden by QA, and turned on
      at a specific time.

* OECD - Senior Engineer serving as Angular and Javascript expertise needed by the team.
  * Migrated the administration portion of the project onto Webpack.
  * Created unit testing pattern that is easier to maintain and author.
  * Helped significantly improve the Protractor.js test stability, including
    implementing custom waits for CSS animations, and drawing on screenshots as
    a means of debugging failing tests caused by obscured objects the tests were
    trying to click on.
  * Created script to serve as a first pass at converting all hard-coded strings
    inside of Angular templates into i18n version, and storing the English
    translation with a friendly lookup name.
