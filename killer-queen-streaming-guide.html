As part of trying to reduce the Portland scene's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus number</a> in regards to our
streaming setup I've recorded notes here as best I can. The dream is to have a
pretty foolproof setup that anyone mildly technically competent could apply to
their scene's cab. People can and should provide suggestions and corrections so
our community can better thrive. As a general policy I won't use a comment
system on this site because static hosting is awesome and also because
<a href="https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js">echo-chamber.js</a> makes an excellent point. Feel free to contact me via email,
Twitter, or carrier pigeon for any improvements we can make here.

Need access to Matt Wire's github repo that has a Rails server.

Changes to the Challonge setup screws up the integration with the Rails server.
The Rails server at that point can't be used (or maybe the data would need to be
wiped). At that point, the server is basically useless to us (and we shouldn't
try troubleshooting the server during a streaming run if possible). Instead
there are text files which override the blue score, blue name, gold score, and
gold name. These appear to be sources in OBS. I haven't verified this yet.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There is a 4 port splitter in cab. Two go to the two monitors. The overhead
monitor takes another slot, and the projector takes the final.
</p>

<p>
This is how our specific setup looks at PDX. Our stream box is the computer
running <a href="http://openbroadcaster.com">OBS</a>.

<p>
Audio runs a weird loop. The mics wire into a mixer that runs to <span class="underline">another</span>
mixer. It's necessary for the headphones to get both the output of the computer
and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidetone">sidetone</a> of the mics themselves. Sidetone is useful so speakers get a
sense that the system is picking up their voice, and also gives them a sense of
how loud they are being picked up.

This setup also provides lots of knobs to turn in terms of making sure the
announcers can turn up their own voices and also turn up the input of what they
are hearing from the game. This is done individually per the mixer and amp knobs
available per input/output (mixer and amp, respectively). <span class="underline">Turn the computer's
audio up to 100% and announcers can turn down as needed.</span>

The known recipe (not fool proof, but most of the work):
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Reboot the cabs with the computer's input (HDMI capture box).</li>
<li>Reintroduce other slots (monitors x2 and the projector).</li>
