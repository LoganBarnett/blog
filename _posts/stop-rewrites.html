<p>
I&rsquo;ve always heard the software engineering industry is a rapidly changing
industry. One of the things that contributes to it (and not the other way
around) is the frequency at which we abandon a pile of work and just start anew.
</p>

<p>
I have not had good experience with this, and this post will go into why. At a
very high level, here&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s one really big point I want to drive home:
Rewrites won&rsquo;t unburden a project from technical debt.
</p>

<h2 id="technical-debt"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Technical Debt</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-technical-debt">
<p>
To understand more deeply about why we want to rewrite a particular piece of
software, we need to first understand the prime motivation and establish it in
this article&rsquo;s lexicon.
</p>

<p>
Technical debt is, in its vaguest sense, a shortcut taken. In the interest of
short term gains, long term gains are sacrificed. This isn&rsquo;t always as sinister
as it sounds. However, projects can become so weighed down by their technical
debt that they cannot move forward anymore. Let&rsquo;s go through a thought
experiment that has nothing at all to do with software.
</p>

<p>
We all have busy days. Let&rsquo;s imagine a day where things get busy: You skip
brushing your teeth in the morning so you can squeeze in a few more minutes to
get to work. Your teeth are external facing bones - they can survive a day of
the bacteria running unchecked. At work, you order the fastest food you can get
and eat it at your desk so you can have more desk time or you don&rsquo;t miss that
meeting. The food isn&rsquo;t healthy, but your stomach acid can strip impurities off
of steel - you&rsquo;ll be alright with one more grease bomb. When you return home
(late), you order some pizza because you can&rsquo;t be bothered to make dinner, and
you barely get to say hello to your children, let alone talk to them about their
lives, school work, etc before they have to go to bed. By the time you&rsquo;re all
done, you&rsquo;re exhausted, so you watch TV for the rest of the night. Eventually
you fall asleep and start the cycle anew. Hopefully tomorrow will go better.
</p>

<p>
I think we&rsquo;ve all had days like this. Ideally, it&rsquo;s painfully obvious that at
if all of this stuff keeps up, you&rsquo;ll need to go to the dentist and get a root
canal. The food you ate will transform your gut bacteria to demand more pizza
and grease bombs. Your kids will grow far apart from you, because you&rsquo;re never
available to be present in their lives. My point probably sounds asinine, but we
all suffer from it. We catch ourselves trying too hard at a particular thing for
weeks on end. We course correct, and we try to make space for all the busy stuff
in life, and focus on the few things that are truly important to us.
</p>

<p>
The grease bomb, pizza, and neglected dental hygiene are all forms of technical
debt that you are conscious of. What about sitting at your desk all day?
Sedentary lifestyles aren&rsquo;t considered healthy. There&rsquo;s many forms of short-cut
decisions made that you weren&rsquo;t even aware of. This also applies to technical
debt.
</p>

<p>
In the software industry, we tend to use technical debt as a mark of shame. But
really, no software project is absent of it. At some point, we need to do
something and move on.
</p>

<p>
That said, technical debt can run unchecked. The blame can be relatively equal:
The software engineers on a project are only so patient, and the folks cutting
the checks for software engineer salaries can&rsquo;t write blank checks. At some
point the project must launch. Maybe you think you have a project with no
technical debt, and maybe that&rsquo;s true - but is that project actually in use?
Without a time constraint, it can be very difficult to finish a project.
</p>

<p>
We do have a few techniques on how to avoid this, and I&rsquo;ll try going into some
of that. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the old software we want to rewrite.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-legacy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="legacy"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Legacy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-legacy">
<p>
Software is not often viewed as fine wines - they do not age nicely. Words like
&ldquo;cruft&rdquo;, and &ldquo;hacky&rdquo; get thrown around. Legacy is oftentimes the term we give to
a project we don&rsquo;t like anymore, because it uses that old technology that
doesn&rsquo;t make our résumés look good. It has poor decisions made against it which
have accumulated worse than barnacles on the hull of a ship. Legacy should truly
mean &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in use&rdquo;, or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in production&rdquo;, rather than that old pile of slop
that we liken to Jim Crow laws.
</p>

<p>
Legacy is powerful. It means your software is in use. Don&rsquo;t ever turn your back
on legacy. Unless you&rsquo;re a startup that&rsquo;s yet to launch, chances are legacy is
what pays your bills. Without it, you are nothing.
</p>

<p>
Legacy can still be hard to work with though. Changing one part of the software
is likely to break some poorly tested or documented behavior. Rolling out
changes, once they are made, can be frustrating and error prone. Generally, the
engineers on the project won&rsquo;t feel like they are setup for success, and they
won&rsquo;t feel like the organization appreciates their efforts, let alone supports
them. This might be far from the truth, but one easy way to make a software
engineer feel bad about their work is to make their work impossible to succeed.
Legacy systems are generally really good at that.
</p>

<p>
One of the ways an organization tries to deal with technical debt is by hiring
people who can either work on new shiny replacements, or maintain the legacy
software. Pulling in more talent might be the right move, but it won&rsquo;t solve the
real issue. Throwing enough money at the problem might look like a great idea on
paper, but it neglects the cause of technical debt in the first place. A mistake
not learned is a mistaken doomed for repetition.
</p>

<p>
To restate that point, because of its importance: Rewriting software will not
buy any reprieve from technical debt.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-the-model" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="the-model"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the-model">
<p>
The model is the core of any software endeavor. I&rsquo;m not talking about doing UML
modeling necessarily. A model is a representation - full stop. Models are
created and enforced by the software. A legacy system with no documented model
still has one - it&rsquo;s just invisible. These are some of the worst models, because
it&rsquo;s only sitting partially in gray matter (someone&rsquo;s brains), which we know to
be a faulty storage and retrieval system.
</p>

<p>
Maybe your model is well documented, but your software is riddled with edge
cases. All that means is that you have two models: The model you want, and the
model you have. The software has the final say on the model.
</p>

<p>
To establish a good model, you need two big habits to start with:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>You maintain your documentation, so your written model and actual model are
never far apart.</li>
<li>You have a far-seeing perspective on the direction of the project.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These are easier said than done.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-the-model--maintaining-documentation" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="the-model--maintaining-documentation"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Maintaining Documentation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-model--maintaining-documentation">
<p>
Maintaining documentation is tricky. Too much documentation and it&rsquo;s a pain to
read, and easy to miss things. Too little documentation, and you diverge from
your actual model. I could write an entire post about documentation and I&rsquo;d
probably still need to break it apart. What I can offer for documentation being
both good and relevant is the documentation&rsquo;s locality, and abandoning the idea
that documentation can skip be skipped.
</p>

<p>
Locality of documentation is simply how close the documentation is to the
subject matter, in terms of its physical proximity. For example, surprising
twists and turns in the source code should be documented right where those
twists and turns are made, as code comments. Justify why you are doing something
surprising. It makes your code easier to review, and easier for those hacks to
potentially be removed in the future if their justification is no longer
relevant. Without those kinds of code comments, you&rsquo;re leaving future
generations to have to remove a vital organ from the patient in order to
discover what that organ was doing.
</p>

<p>
For documentation that&rsquo;s more overarching for your application, don&rsquo;t
document that in your application&rsquo;s entrypoint. Move to a README, or even
better: a place where you can put up diagrams and link to other documentation
(READMEs can be great entrypoints for this as well, but not all readers will
have access to your source code, nor want it).
</p>

<p>
The single greatest sin of the Agile Manifesto is the words &ldquo;Prefer working
software over documentation&rdquo;. They are referring to giant contracting work where
documentation is forever but there&rsquo;s no actual working software yet because it
wasn&rsquo;t written yet. There&rsquo;s a painted picture of giant organizations that get
lost in software requirements and documentation, but don&rsquo;t forget, NASA works
that way and, to date, no small startup has landed on the Moon by building a
rocket one week at a time. The painted picture is skewed, inaccurate - or at
least how its come to manifest in the minds of the community. The number of Ruby
libraries whose documentation is simply the RDoc comments begrudgingly left in
the codebase (and perhaps ignored) is testament to this. Ruby had its hay day
but that day is gone. It turns out the ecosystem is just not great for long term
software projects. The attitude of &ldquo;look at the code&rdquo; for documentation is not
sustainable.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-model--perspective-on-what's-to-come">
<p>
Knowing what you&rsquo;re building is so essential if you&rsquo;re building it. While I
loathe the actual construction metaphor we use in software engineering, this is
a place where it is apt. You can construct a building precisely one room at a
time, but if you don&rsquo;t know how tall the building is going to be (one story, or
a sky scraper?), or how many rooms you&rsquo;ll need, and what the purposes of the
rooms will be, things are going to get really tricky. Plumbing, electrical, and
ventilation all need planning, and it changes at larger scales. The ventilation
and electrical needs differ between bedrooms, kitchens, gyms, and bathrooms.
</p>

<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t mean you need every exacting detail up front, but it does mean you
need a good idea of where you&rsquo;re going. It&rsquo;s impossible to know exactly what is
desired from a given project. Software engineers building software for
themselves can&rsquo;t even get this right.
</p>

<p>
But it helps. If you&rsquo;re making a text editor, have you thought about how your
key bindings are going to work, or are you just going to add them as you go? The
former leads to Vim&rsquo;s composable key bindings. The latter leads to TextMate,
which keeps getting reincarnated (TextMate 2, Sublime, Atom, VS Code, and
whatever is next). Meanwhile, Vim is 30 years old and still attracts new users.
Emacs enjoys a 45 year age - it doesn&rsquo;t use composable key bindings (unless you
count <code>evil-mode</code>), but it has a solid model built into its customization.
TextMate might not even be the first in its lineage, but rest assured there will
come more. At some point, the editor just becomes so bloated with various needs
pressed upon it that nobody can make anything new for it. Features are riddled
with obscure quirks and keeping the system able to build on modern platforms
becomes increasingly difficult. I haven&rsquo;t even seen these code bases and I know
this to be true, and the evidence is in the lineage: We keep making the same
editor over and over again. Why is that? Why weren&rsquo;t we happy with Atom? Why do
people still learn Emacs and Vim? One set had a model, and the other set were a
Minimal Viable Products (MVP).
</p>

<p>
Gaining this perspective takes time where engineers aren&rsquo;t twiddling bits and
writing code. It takes time where documents are put together, and understanding
is laid out. Make room for this, lest you lose the true model of the
application. You&rsquo;ll know you missed the mark when you feel like your application
is riddled with edge cases.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-the-model--edge-cases" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="the-model--edge-cases"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Edge Cases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-the-model--edge-cases">
<p>
We&rsquo;ve talked a little bit about edge cases but haven&rsquo;t established exactly what
they are. Edge cases are simply exceptions. Spelling in the English language is
riddled with edge cases. <a href="https://www.econtentpro.com/blog/i-before-e-except-after-c-exceptions/18">&ldquo;I before E except after C&rdquo;</a> is a really common one, but
even the linked article I point to says there are exceptions to that exception.
Exceptception! But software gets like that too. We say we always do this one
thing for billing, except in the case of that one client. Our application
displays a table with 8 columns, except when the first record has a certain
value and then it&rsquo;s either 5 columns or 12.
</p>

<p>
Edge cases is the real model coming out, and the engineers on the project are
chasing it like a rainbow. Edge cases are a sign that the code is too specific.
It needs more generic things in place so it can hinge at certain points more
easily. If a particular action needs to be done by a certain client, don&rsquo;t make
that happen for the client - use your data (model) to handle that via some kind
of flag or other state you can examine. Then that client is flagged with the
state you expect. Huzzah! Now the state you&rsquo;re talking about is not specific to
the client. When you see this state, you do this other thing. If you see a
different state, you might do something else entirely. It&rsquo;s a system that now
expresses not just one thing thought to be an exception, but all of the
exceptions!
</p>

<p>
Coming back to English, English is composed of many languages, but has its
lineage in a Germanic language and a Latin language (French, I believe).
Knowing the origin of the word (Germanic, Latin, or even something else like
Greek) significantly assists in its spelling. English requires a more complex
model of a language because of its split heritage. While planning things out is
important, software is just as organic as a spoken language. It must adapt to
changing circumstances, and no design will be perfect for all possible futures.
This why it&rsquo;s important to cultivate a sense of understanding of the code base,
and understand that looking at an edge case is really just a place where your
desired model needs to catch up with the actual model.

<h2 id="other-costs-of-rewriting"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Other Costs of Rewriting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-other-costs-of-rewriting">
<p>
Rewriting software is a colossal ask. It&rsquo;s basically saying &ldquo;I need to disappear
for months, and I will come back with a piece of software that is not in feature
parity with the old software, and it will actually have more bugs than the old
software because it isn&rsquo;t as battle tested&rdquo;. And you might think &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m
rewriting it in language X which has strong/static types&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have a new
testing methodology that will make it impossible to miss such obvious things
next time&rdquo;, and you&rsquo;re both right and wrong. You&rsquo;ll find the organization won&rsquo;t
tolerate you disappearing for so long (even if they signed up for it initially),
and you&rsquo;re back at the point where you are motivated to cut corners again. Once
again, you&rsquo;re making those tradeoffs which favor short term gains for long term
gains, because this thing needs to get out the door. Meanwhile, that legacy
system keeps paying the bills.
</p>

<p>
So once you convince the organization to do the rewrite, and you do it, you&rsquo;ll
forever have this mark upon you. Never again will you be allowed to do a
rewrite. Fresh blood might be able to make the pitch and say the right things,
but you&rsquo;re done. And why should it be any other way? The organization extended
you trust, and you managed to make a clone that&rsquo;s just a little more shiny for
new prospective engineers. That was not what was promised. Even if they helped
you create another pile of technical debt.

<p>
This isn&rsquo;t to say you can&rsquo;t update things. I dislike how much &ldquo;software
engineering&rdquo; equates to &ldquo;web development&rdquo; - there are many other disciplines
within software than just web applications! I also feel like I&rsquo;m often at odds
with the opinions of Martin Fowler, but his article on <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html">StrangleFigApplication</a> is
spot on. Credit where credit is due!
</p>

<p>
The gist is that if you need a new system, you need to build it around or within
the legacy system. Have the old system start deferring calls to the new system,
or wrap the legacy system in the new system, and have the new system start by
deferring <span class="underline">all</span> of its calls to the legacy system. Sure it has overhead, but I
bet it&rsquo;s overhead you can afford. You&rsquo;re in legacy, remember? This allows you to
safely swap out small pieces of the application at a time, until eventually the
legacy system either no longer called or just a hallow shell of its former self.
At some critical point, you flip the rest over.
</p>

<p>
This will let you move to new frameworks, or even runtimes. Depending on your
domain, this might have some obstacles to overcome. I don&rsquo;t know how you&rsquo;d
migrate a Unity3D game to Unreal. Maybe there&rsquo;s some techniques though. You can
figure out a strategy (like move your primary game logic to something that both
Unity3D and Unreal can operate with).
</p>

<p>
For web calls, this is basically setting up a reverse proxy between the new and
legacy system.

<p>
I did say you&rsquo;ll still have technical debt. You need to cultivate the skill of
cleaning as you go, and sometimes just leveraging time to actually work on a
proper solution. Though I will say, once you&rsquo;ve seen abstract solutions to your
problems, it becomes easier to just put them in to begin with. That first client
exception that comes in introduces a tag applied to clients that introduces
additional behavior.

<p>
If you&rsquo;re stuck on a legacy system, know that while you probably have some
difficult times, and you feel like you&rsquo;re trudging through a murky bog, keep in
mind that time has different meaning to you than an unproven startup. Those
startups are essentially bleeding out until they can launch and then staunch the
blood (money) flow. In legacy, you&rsquo;re at least up and running. The trick is to
avoid egg-on-face, such as promising the world so you can get that rewrite.
Don&rsquo;t do it!
