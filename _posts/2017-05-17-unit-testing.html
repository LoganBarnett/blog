I find myself talking a lot about unit testing in my current workplace. Over
time I've learned things from others as well as developed some habits that have
served me well. I've gotten applications up to 100% test coverage without
Herculean effort. Granted, test coverage is not the same as test quality, it's
still a useful metric. I've demonstrated that there is at least <span class="underline">one case</span> in
which my code can work.

As a quick intro: Unit tests are tiny little bits of code that aren't part of
your implementation code, but exercise your implementation code. You have a
suite of micro applications that run together to ensure certain behaviors in
your application are doing things they should still be doing. Instead of having
a throwaway application that tests the one thing you were working on, think
about keeping it. That's basically a unit test. A test harness that you save and
run together with a bunch of others just like it.

Unit testing is hard for a lot of people. I believe a vast majority of the
difficulty is self inflicted though. I've put together a list of things that are
very helpful with testing. It's by no means exhaustive, and this isn't a
religion to adopt. I find reasonable exceptions to these rules - but they do
remain as exceptions.

<p>
As I see more and more people doing things like using loops to create tests
and factoring out swathes of code just to make tests a little more terse, I
find the tests get complex enough that I'm about to demand going to demand
unit tests for the unit tests. Unit tests should be incredibly simple. Sure,
helpers are useful. Especially with Angular's ceremony. That said, each test
should be a little different. It should assert something else. It should
provide a unique piece of data. If you're doing TDD (failing test -&gt; passing
test), you'll find that you pivot on every point in your tests. It's ok for
unit tests to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself#DRY_vs_WET_solutions">WET</a>!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-how-to-make-unit-testing-not-so-much-of-a-pain--dress-for-success--test-driven-development">
<p>
Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a powerful means of having good unit
tests in your code. The basic trick to pulling off high test coverage
(getting 100% isn't as impossible as it sounds) is to make sure you always
start with a failing test. Want to change something? Make a test that asserts
something that currently is not true. Now write implementation code to make
it pass. The sad part about TDD is it requires this discipline. Sometimes
you'll want to explore and writing tests first don't make sense because you
don't even know what to assert in the first place. That said, if you're
transforming data (where a lot of your efforts should be), or doing general
webby stuff that isn't that mysterious, you really should be able to write
some tests. If it helps, get another programmer to pair with and have them
write some tests with you.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-how-to-make-unit-testing-not-so-much-of-a-pain--dress-for-success--keep-your-tests">
<p>
Another trick to making TDD shine: Don't delete tests as you put the code
together. Each new test refines the old behavior, but the old truths you
assert are still the same.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-how-to-make-unit-testing-not-so-much-of-a-pain--dress-for-success--assert-a-single-truth-per-test">
<p>
If you can, and you should be able to do this a lot, make a single assertion
of truth per test. This means <code>expect</code> or <code>assert</code> once per test. If you want
to assert more things, write more tests. They might even be mostly
duplicates. There's benefit to doing this though. Each test becomes a small
bit of living documentation. When the tests fail due to a change, the
engineer can go look at the test and see the expectation. There should be a
firm, human language description of what the tests is doing. "It returns an
empty list when given an empty string". We aren't writing poetry here, so
it's ok if it's dull. You'll thank yourself months later when you've
forgotten everything you've worked on and the unit test stands as guardian to
the old behavior. Even if you decide to sweep away that test, you'll at least
be doing so as an informed decision. Someone else might pick up your work,
and they don't have the knowledge you have accumulated and now take for
granted. When you make multiple assertions per test, the truths of your work
are lost.

<h4 id="how-to-make-unit-testing-not-so-much-of-a-pain--dress-for-success--clearly-state-your-intent"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.5</span> Clearly state your intent</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-how-to-make-unit-testing-not-so-much-of-a-pain--dress-for-success--clearly-state-your-intent">
<p>
The "it renders" and "it works" kinds of tests are comically bad descriptors
for a test. Better tests look like "shows a list of users ordered by last
name". Your test should clearly state its intent of what it's trying to
test. When a test shows a failure, you as the human must go in and determine
one of these two outcomes:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The test is wrong due to new changes, and must be updated.</li>
<li>The test is correct, and your implementation needs an update to
accommodate prior, expected behavior.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The only way to truly determine this is to have a clearly written test that
briefly describes <b>the scenario of the test</b> and <b>the expected outcome</b>.
</p>

<p>
As a side note, I strongly prefer to omit the "should" kind of verbiage
because:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>80 columns wide is the best. Don't make me lug a monitor to this coffee
shop so I can read your damn test descriptor. "should " costs you ~6
precious characters of width, while adding absolutely nothing to your
test.</li>
<li>"Should" is a "weasel word", meaning contributes to an ambiguous
statement. If your test doesn't pass, then it "should"&#x2026;? How's about we
state clearly that our test does a thing, and anything else is considered
an error/failure condition? Avoiding weasel words can be scary, because
it requires a little bit of confidence or gal. That's okay! It's okay to
make a statement and then be proven wrong! But making statements that are
never wrong is a defensive strategy you don't need when all of us just
want to find a way that works (arguably the "right way", if such a thing
exists).</li>

<p>
This ties heavily in with asserting a single truth. Another way of asserting
a single truth is to avoid the "Given this input I get this slight change in
this giant output" kind of tests. The look like tests where inputs are
provided, and you get a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object">blob</a> of JSON or something similar. The test then
asserts that the <span class="underline">entire</span> JSON structure matches the output. This makes the
test hard to follow. What bits are important? Why are they important? Most
imporantly: What's relevant to this single truth being asserted? Blob tests
make this very difficult to determine. After you write a bunch of tiny little
tests, you could make an "All together now" test that does a quick sanity
check: Do all of these things I just made work in concert together? That's
completely reasonable, but don't go making 20 more of them. They are the
exception, not the rule. A pattern I'll sometimes use as a micro-blob test is
perform some operation on a collection of things. Do a quick <code>map</code> to pluck
out some data I'm interested in (almost always a single field), and then
assert that the list I got back from <code>map</code> is some list I provide. The list
is small, and usually the test will describe its assertion in terms of
something that makes sense for a list. "It returns a list of users
alphabetically sorted by first name ascending" is a perfect example of this.

<p>
This might sound like a trolling statement, but seriously, if your
organization is keen to it - don't write them. Not for applications. Your
tests should only exercise through the application's normal interface. In
the case of libraries, it's the API you want to test. If it's a web
application, then interface through the browser. With a restful service you
can use <code>curl</code> for most of it, or similar tooling. These "full stack",
"integration", or "acceptance" tests provide immense value. They test that
your software does what it says on the tin.
</p>

<p>
Consider writing a calculator application. Somewhere in there, I might have
a plus function for adding two registers together. I can exercise this with
unit tests until my boss pulls me aside for having a two thousand line file
for testing a single function that is built into most languages. But it
still might not work. That's because a calculator application isn't consumed
via its plus function. There are loads of pieces often involved in our
software to make it do something that seems very simple to an end user. It's
better to make sure all of that is connected without having to manually
dissect each part of your application and discreetly test one piece of it at
a time, and hope you caught all of the integration points.

<p>
Also consider that you should be using the computer and smart people who
have come before you to have figured some of your work out for you already.
Having an algebraic type system without binding yourself to sequential
mutations (I'm looking at you, Object Oriented) means you can eliminate vast
classes of unit tests you might write. Can this be <code>null</code>? No? Then you
never have to check for it! Yes? Well then you <span class="underline">must</span> check for it. The type
system won't let you get away with "Well I just won't pass it <code>null</code>"). Your
type system can cover 90% of your unit testing needs. The other 10% are
handled much better by your acceptance tests.

<p>
Admittedly, we may not have as much control over our ecosystem as we would
like. Perhaps you inherited a suite of unit tests. Nudging towards some kind
of acceptance tests would be stellar, along with integrating a type system.
Sometimes we must simply make do.

There's more we could into here, but perfect is the enemy of good, and I need
to cut it off at some point. Unit tests can be very handy, make think about
your code before you just start typing stuff, serve as excellent test
harnesses to verify changes, and can serve as living documentation to help
prevent mistakes when you start making changes in your application. Hopefully
this helps clear some hurdles on how to make the process easier and therefore
more attainable.
