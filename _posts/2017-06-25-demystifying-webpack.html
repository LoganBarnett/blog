I've played with a lot of the Javascript build tools in the ecosystem. Today,
<a href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack</a> is my go to. I like it because it adds static analysis to my file paths
for virtually everything. It also has fairly clear ways in which it transforms
files. As with any tool, there's trade-offs to it. I can't get map files working
for my unit tests, and the initial builds can take a really long time (upwards
of a minute). Sure I can turn some features off to speed it up, but then I'll
miss certain errors. For example, Angular's dependency injection system can lean
on just the function parameter names, which break when any kind of minification
is done. If I'm not minifying, I'm potentially missing those errors.
</p>

<p>
Maybe someone can help me with the test stuff though. That would be just dandy.
Until then, I consider it something lost in the transition to Webpack.
</p>

<p>
Grunt is a tool introduced to me very early on in my budding Javascript career.
I quickly found it nightmarish to work with for non-trivial projects. In
fairness, Grunt really isn't a build tool - <a href="https://gruntjs.com">just look at their site</a>. It's a task
runner. People shape it into a build tool much like when schools shaped my
grandmother into being a right hander by slapping her wrist with a ruler anytime
she used her left hand. Grunt tasks don't really chain into each other very
well, so when you have multiple steps in your file transformations they usually
look like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
.tmp/foo.css             # Convert from less to css
.tmp-tmp/foo.css         # Add browser prefixes
.tmp-tmp-tmp/foo.min.css # Minify css
dist/foo.min.css         # Actually write the final result
</pre>

<p>
And when you make a change the file has to flow through all of that again. If
for some reason you need to make a change to the build system, like throw
something in the middle, it's not exactly clear that you updated all of the
right things in the right places. Each task needs to know where the prior task
had left its files, so it could pick them up and continue a transformation. It
wasn't long before I loathed the idea of making tweaks to my Grunt config. This
introduced resistance to change. "It works now - don't touch it". I made the
jump to Gulp. It helped with the above setup! But if I needed to do any
non-one-way transformations, I ran into issues with Gulp's piping mechanism.

At time of writing, Webpack is at version 3.1.0. My examples are written with
Webpack v2.x in mind, but so far is working against Webpack v3.x.
This is what Webpack's file transformation looks like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
???
</pre>

<p>
Uh, wait. Where's my files? I fired up the webpack dev server like a good
engineer and my reward is no files? Well, that's correct. Webpack keeps
everything in memory for as long as it can. In the case of a dev server where it
hosts everything, all of the files are held in memory.
</p>

Webpack might seem like magic on the surface, but nothing could be further from
the truth. In the realm of programming, "magic" is usually something we describe
as obeying some convention and because we did, things Just Work(tm). See <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>.
Like all of it. Webpack demands of you an entry point. The <code>void main()</code> of your
application. In Javascript land, this just means a Javascript file. This is how
an entry point file might look:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">require<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #2d9574;">'./base.css'</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;

<span style="color: #4f97d7; font-weight: bold;">var</span> <span style="color: #7590db;">color</span> = require<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span><span style="color: #2d9574;">'color'</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span> <span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">// </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">I don't know that the color lib does this, so</span>&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
                             <span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">// </span><span style="color: #2aa1ae; background-color: #292e34;">just pretend.</span>&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
utils.banner<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>color.rainbow<span style="color: #bc6ec5;">(</span><span style="color: #2d9574;">'ohai world'</span><span style="color: #bc6ec5;">)</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You might recognize <code>require</code> Node.js. Browsers don't have a built in <code>require</code>,
but Webpack provides one when it builds your runtime. <code>require</code> takes a path
which can be relative or a "module" (from out of your node<sub>modules</sub>). Webpack
does something extra though. It performs static analysis on these files. You
might have noticed we're requiring a css file at the start of our entry point.
We're not doing anything with it directly, but we're telling Webpack we want
this file, and it should be included in our bundle somehow. Webpack will look
for a <code>base.css</code> in the same directory our entry point is in, since we provided
a relative path. Fun fact: IDEs and editors can be configured to auto-complete
file names when they think you are providing a path. That css file might in turn
have images it refers to, or even fonts. These paths will also be analyzed.
Webpack will often munge these paths somehow, but it keeps them consistent
internally. So we don't have to worry ourselves on how the file paths look in
the final build. We just have to make sure at develop-time that everything is in
the right places as defined by our <code>require</code> and equivalent statements.
</p>

<p>
How does Webpack do all of this? Magic??

<div id="outline-container-orgbf03093" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbf03093"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Loaders</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Well, not exactly. Webpack has these sort-of plugins called <span class="underline">loaders</span>. A loader
is simply a means of transforming handling kinds of files. For css, I typically
will use <code>css-loader</code>. There's also a <code>babel-loader</code> from going from ES6 to ES5
conversions, and loaders for html templates or even the <code>index.html</code> itself.
These loaders give Webpack the context it needs to walk every file you need for
your build. Javascript files use <code>require</code> and <code>import</code>. Html can use the <code>src</code>
attribute from image tags (and a lot more). Css files can use fonts and <code>url()</code>.
These are all provided via the various loaders that you will configure for your
project. At build time, Webpack finds all of these files and makes sure that the
urls will remain consistent throughout the bundling process. If it can't find a
file at a particular path, the bundle will fail. If a file is not included
directly or indirectly from your entry-point, the file will not be included in
the bundle. This allows Webpack to make very small builds because it only
includes what's needed.
</p>

<p>
Loaders can also be chained together. You can have a <code>sass-loader</code> which pipes
into the <code>postcss-loader</code> which in turn goes to the <code>css-loader</code>. It's important
to remember that these chain in reverse order. I like to think it goes from
"outer" to "inner". Think of it like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">foo<span style="color: #4f97d7;">(</span>bar<span style="color: #bc6ec5;">(</span>baz<span style="color: #2d9574;">()</span><span style="color: #bc6ec5;">)</span><span style="color: #4f97d7;">)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this setup, <code>baz</code> gets called first, then the results are passed to <code>bar</code>,
and then those results are passed to <code>foo</code>. Compare that to a chain of loaders:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript"><span style="color: #4f97d7;">{</span>&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
  test: <span style="color: #2d9574;">/\.css$/</span>,&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
  use: <span style="color: #bc6ec5;">[</span>&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
    <span style="color: #2d9574;">'css-loader'</span>,&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
    <span style="color: #2d9574;">'csso-loader'</span>,&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
    <span style="color: #2d9574;">'postcss-loader'</span>,&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
  <span style="color: #bc6ec5;">]</span>,&#57344;&#57345;&#57345;
<span style="color: #4f97d7;">}</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Here, <code>postcss-loader</code> goes first, then <code>csso-loader</code>, and finally <code>css-loader</code>.
Pick whatever mnemonic works best for you.

<p>
Once you have all of these loaders arranged, there's a few plugins I want to
call out that make it all hum. <code>extract-text-webpack-plugin</code> is great for
extracting your CSS into its own file. The alternative is to stuff it all in a
<code>style</code> tag. My preference is an external file. The next is
<code>html-webpack-plugin</code> coupled with <code>html-loader</code>. These let you take your
<code>index.html</code> and it dynamically adds the appropriate <code>script</code> and <code>link</code> tags to
your assets. It also insures that the html file is provided with the rest of
your bundle.

Sometimes this Webpack stuff can be confusing. Since Webpack 2 a lot of the
documentation has improved, but there's still gaps, and it's easy to conflate
the Webpack 1 docs and other resources with Webpack 2. Don't feel bad if it
seems like it's taking you a while to get started with Webpack. For you bloggers
and other people posting resources out there, be sure to include at least a
major version number and a date on your material. The Internet is getting old,
and we need to be mindful that there's a lot of dated information floating
around out there. For those of us reading materials, be sure to check dates and
version numbers when they are provided, and use skepticism when neither can be
found. Open source has a lot of benefits, but can be problematic because
documentation is perhaps the least sexy thing about it. It also is hard to
produce docs when you're simply sharing an itch you scratched for yourself. Keep
your expectations healthy! And pull requests for documentation are typically
very welcome. If you ever want to get your name on a big project to claim some
internet fame, I'd do it through documentation for sure.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully this sheds some light on how Webpack works. Not everything will be
simple and easy dealing with it, but here you have sane start with something
very simple and bare bones.
