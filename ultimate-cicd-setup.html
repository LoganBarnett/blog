CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration / Continous (Delivery|Deployment).
Roughly when we refer to this, we're talking about an automated
build/test/deployment suite of tools. Virtually all of your big programs you
write are useless if they just run on your personal computer. You need to put
them somewhere so they can run when your computer is off, or other people need
to be able to use the software you made. So we need to deploy the software
somewhere, and the software needs to be consumable in a way that doesn't require
your machine's development setup for those who need to consume said software.

<h2 id="org7960bd1"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> general philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
You want to automate as much as possible. I've worked at software shops where
there's a <span class="underline">6 month</span> delay between the business analyst putting together
requirements and seeing those ideas arrive as a software solution in production.
That doesn't include any time spent actually developing the software. That's
just time spent going through various phases of the release process and work
scheduling. Software shops will choose this approach as a means of deliberately
slowing down the development process. They want to make change painful, and in
doing so they hypothetically make it such that fewer errors can spring up. I
love pointing at <a href="http://testobsessed.com/2015/05/i-prefer-this-over-that/">I Prefer This Over That</a> for reading material on the topic.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that unless you have your engineers sitting on their hands
through most of the release process, there's going to be a swathe of changes
that come earmarked with that one feature you wanted, all in the same release.
Since the delta is huge, it's hard to ascertain the root of a problem when it
does happen. And it will. The trick to keeping software relatively easy is
keeping it simple. Releasing 12 features and 8 bug fixes all at once is not
simple. That's complex.
</p>

<p>
Even if you <span class="underline">did</span> slow it down so you released one thing at a time, you still
run into the problem of figuring out what the hell happened 6 months ago.
Frequently codebases will look almost foreign when you're talking about that
kind of time delta. And the kicker is you might have found and fixed the bug 1
month after the release was cut. Now what? Do you backport the fix? Well that
might have required a bunch of other changes to go with it. What happens most of
the time is you just fix it again (which is a different fix since the codebase
differs so greatly.
</p>

<p>
A much better solution is to make it so mistakes are cheap to fix. When you make
a fix it's always against the latest version of your software. You're current.
You don't need to do archaeological digs in your codebase. You make the fix, you
test it, you deploy it, you check that the deployed version works, you move on.
You don't want to just deploy anything though. Software has gotten really good
about various levels of verification and checks we can perform to make sure our
software does what we think it should do. Those checks can be run as part of
that deployment process. Any failure in the process means no deployment. The
general approach here is to automate virtually every part of this process.

<h3 id="orga85b326"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> small releases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
Releases should be done frequently and not when people are about to go home for
the day. Frequent releases mean small releases. That means if something goes
wrong, it's not painful to roll back. With orgs that do giant releases, they
generally do a big release, and then hold a <a href="https://project-management-knowledge.com/definitions/w/war-room/">war room</a> to catch the fallout. When
you have several applications each with several features and fixes, you've
introduced so many variables that it's nearly impossible to narrow down the
culprit in a timely fashion when <span class="underline">your app is broken in the sacred production
environment</span>. Any integration point requires people from multiple teams - I've
even seen where an integration between two apps pulls in people from 3-4 teams
because two teams stand in the middle of the apps (usually operations and
security). This is a colossal waste of resources and very damaging to your
team's morale. If someone deploys a new button and the button screws up your
page layout, reverting is a no brainer.

<p>
You can use flags (generally configuration variables) in your codebase to
disable or enable certain features. Take the button out entirely and only enable
it when you want to. This makes it easy to deploy changes all the way to
production because your code when deployed shouldn't do anything until you
actually flip the switch. This is

Software engineer salaries are pretty high, and costs for hardware or hosting is
very low. Having an environment where your software gets automatically deployed
on any successful build is essential.
</p>

<p>
You need environments. An environment is a place where the software lives. This
might be a server where your web app gets deployed. It also accounts for other
apps that need to live alongside your primary app. Getting environments going
needs to be cheap. You should have scripts to define your environment. If your
environment setup is just "our server person hammered on it until it worked"
then you're going to have all kinds of variance between your environments that's
subtle and impossible to account for. You will invite disaster in your
deployment process. Script it, and have the scripts take variables on what
environment the setup occurs.
</p>

<p>
Let's cover some environments and how you'd use them:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>local</dt><dd>This is your local environment, or what you do to iterate quickly on
your machine. I've seen some places that don't actually have a local
environment. You just edit in a develop server that might or might
not be shared by other engineers. This is bad. Having your engineer
be able to work from anywhere is valuable. Connection issues should
not hamper your development process. That means you need to be able
to run as much as possible locally and test as much as possible
locally.</dd>
<dt>develop</dt><dd>(Or <code>dev</code>) is an environment with a singular purpose: It
demonstrates that the software can run when it's not in the <code>local</code>
environment. I recommend <code>develop</code> continues to run with whatever
mocks you have. Your CI/CD setup should automatically deploy to
this environment once you successfully automatically test and build
the software. You can use it as a "here's what's current" place as
well. I would let QA know about this environment, but create the
expectation that there's a proverbial gun pointed at it. The data
that exists there, and any running processes are forfeit no a whim.</dd>
<dt>integration</dt><dd>This like <code>develop</code> except it interfaces with real external
tooling. If your app needs to talk to another app, this is the
environment where it <span class="underline">actually</span> happens. If you're in a large
org with lots of apps, this is where all of them can meet. Lots
of shops like to gate deployment here - meaning some human has
to hit a button to make what's in <code>develop</code> is deployed to
<code>integration</code>. This is not a great idea. The problem gating an
<code>integration</code> deployment is trying to solve is that if someone
else relies on your software working a certain way, then your
cutting-edge deployments will break their stuff. Breaking here
is a good thing. We need to be able to enable or disable
functionality using feature flags, or use versioned API calls
to prevent backwards incompatible changes from breaking our
consumers. Automated deploys to <code>integration</code> allow us to catch
those. The whole point of this environment is that we find out
what's breaking when we connect everything together. If this
hampers your consumers' development process, then have a
discussion about how to mock whatever it is they are consuming.</dd>
<dt>staging</dt><dd>This is QA's test bed. It should be gated. The reason being is that
QA needs to be able to test things without the test subject being
ripped out from under them. That said, it's not an excuse to allow
<code>staging</code> to drift far behind of what <code>develop</code> is. The larger the
delta in changes, the more painful it will be to fix any problems
that got deployed.</dd>
<dt>production</dt><dd>AKA <code>prod</code>. This is where our end users consume our software.
This place is sacred ground and changes made to this environment
should be made with extreme caution. Deployment should be gated
here, but realistically speaking you could have multiple
production deployments per day. Any time QA approves a software
change in <code>staging</code> we should do a deployment to <code>production</code>.</dd>

<h3 id="orgae06b54"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> release notes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Lots of places require release notes to be present as part of a release. Release
notes, or a change log is a list of what's different about this particular
version of the software. For some reason this is one of the easier things to
automate that we generally fail to automate. Be lazy. Let the computer do the
work for you. It's better at it than you are anyways.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example of what release notes might look like:
</p>

<pre class="example">
My Shiny App v1.1.2

1. Fixed issue #12344 :: Clicking buttons no longer mocks you for clicking them
                        out of order.
2. Fixed issue #15532 :: The app no longer crashes when you try to do useful
                        things in it.
3. New Feature :: You can now add stickers to your reviews even if it adds no
                  inherent value to your reviews. I just know this is what they
                  did in SnapChat and they are worth bazillions okay?
</pre>

<p>
But if you're a mobile developer you'll get a free pass:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Bugfixes and performance enhancements.
</pre>

<p>
See how far something like that will go on your résumé.
</p>

<p>
Let's just assume that we want to write quality software for a moment and show
some intention behind the changes we make. If we <span class="underline">must</span> add the ability to hold
the thumb button to make the thumbs up icon bigger, at least we'll know it got
in there on purpose.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org6740fa0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org6740fa0"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.1</span> branch naming</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-1">
<p>
In the good example above, those release notes could be built with some tooling.
Assuming you're using <code>git</code> or something similar for your code, you can enforce
a naming convention on your branches. Something like <code>&lt;ticket
number&gt;/small-decription</code>. Some places like to do <code>bugfix</code> and <code>feature</code> as
prefixes to the branch names. I find this just gets in the way. Give me a ticket
number and I can find the branch easily without needing to know if it's a bug
fix or feature (and sometime those lines can get really blurred anyways). A real
example might be <code>5342/add-performance-metrics</code>. Notice that there's no capital
letters nor spaces. It's too easy to be inconsistent with casing and spaces
generally have special meaning in just about all of our tools. When your system
does its automatic checks against new work, it can verify that the branch name
matches the format.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgba91d9e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgba91d9e"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.2</span> commit messages</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-2">
<p>
As an added benefit, adding the ticket number to the commit messages also can
help if you need to play CSI on your codebase later. Software engineers are
rightfully lazy. Don't ask them to do this unless you like talking to walls.
Instead make a pre-commit hook that adds the ticket number by getting it from
the branch name. This makes doing forensics easier because generally you don't
always have branch information when you poke around in the logs. Seeing
individual commits with ticket numbers will be a boon, and some history viewers
will connect your version control to the ticket system, so those ticket numbers
become clickable links to the tickets. The ticket system can also link back to
commits and branches because you referred to them. Let the computer work for
you!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org10f00fe" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org10f00fe"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.3</span> pull requests</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-3">
<p>
The new hotness with merging work is forming a pull request. Your CI/CD software
can do an additional check: When the pull request is formed, require that
there's something in there as a release message. The pull request might normally
look like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Fixes issue [[112356]] by ceasing our blatant addiction to =null=. It's ok to
use an empty list. Seriously.

I also cleaned up the comments in that area because they were filthy lies.
</pre>

<p>
That's well and good, but that's not something we really want to show as release
notes to Powers That Be or our users. Let's add a special bit of text we can
easily search for:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Fixes issue [[112356]] by ceasing our blatant addiction to =null=. It's ok to
use an empty list. Seriously.

I also cleaned up the comments in that area because they were filthy lies.

RELEASE NOTE: Fix a bug where the app would crash if you forgot to add at least
one student to the test.

<div id="outline-container-orgba0d3bd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgba0d3bd"><span class="section-number-4">3.3.4</span> stringing together the whole process</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-3-4">
<p>
Now here's the kicker, you make some tooling that looks at the commit hash for
the last release you did, and do a log all the way to the hash of the current
release you're doing. Collect all of the ticket numbers out of those commits,
and then look for pull requests that also have those ticket numbers. Ask each
pull request for its description and pull out the <code>RELEASE NOTE</code> text. That's
what you stuff into your release notes.
